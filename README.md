# Standard ebooks custom list

Alternative interface for awesome website [standardebooks.org](https://standardebooks.org). Just a list of books with some essential info like author, title, description, cover, link to the download page, words count, etc. Also, you can star a book or mark it as read â€” this data saved locally in your browser. 

### Update books list
Get repo for loading books and download them:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/standardebooks/web/

```shell
# cd back to this repo
yarn getbooks
```
This command updates books.json and book covers. Then commit to master and push.

cd ../standardebooks.org/web/www/ebooks
rm -rf */
```
