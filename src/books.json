A.</abbr> Milne</a>, better known for his children’s writing, who wrote this book for his father in 1922. It is his only mystery novel and was very popular at the time.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Mark Ablett is the amiable host of a country-house party to which his estranged brother, Robert, arrives from Australia. Robert is the black sheep of the family who is said to have borrowed money in the past and had written to warn of his visit. One afternoon a gunshot is heard, and Robert is found shot in the head while locked in the library, while his brother Mark has vanished. Tony Gillingham, who has arrived to visit Bill Beverley, one of the guests at the house-party, takes it upon himself to investigate the death. Together Tony and Bill form a Holmes and Watson partnership and seek to solve the mystery in an unorthodox manner, taking over from a bumbling police force.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Red House Mystery</i> has divided opinion on its literary merit but it remains an entertaining and intriguing read nonetheless.</p>\n\t\t",

Its publication ushered in a new era of thinking and discussion about how economies function, a sea change away from the older, increasingly-irrelevant mercantilist and physiocratic views of economics towards a new practical application of economics for the birth of the industrial era. Its scope is vast, touching on concepts like free markets, supply and demand, division of labor, war, and public debt. Its fundamental message is that the wealth of a nation is measured not by the gold in the monarch’s treasury, but by its national income, which in turn is produced by labor, land, and capital.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Some ten years in the writing, <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> is the product of almost two decades of notes, study, and discussion. It was released to glowing praise, selling out its first print run in just six months and going through five subsequent editions and countless reprintings in Smith’s lifetime. It began inspiring legislators almost immediately and continued to do so well into the 1800s, and influenced thinkers ranging from <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexander-hamilton_john-jay_james-madison\">Alexander Hamilton</a> to <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karl-marx_friedrich-engels\">Karl Marx</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Today, it is the second-most-cited book in the social sciences that was published before 1950, and its legacy as a foundational text places it in the stratosphere of civilization-changing books like <i>Principia Mathematica</i> and <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-darwin/the-origin-of-species\">The Origin of Species</a></i>.</p>\n\t\t",

However, they all share a certain quality of prose that marks them out as belonging to the collection regardless of authorship. It’s that quality, combined with their insight into the human character, that has meant that they’ve stood the test of time for twenty-five centuries.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This collection is the 1912 translation by V.

After a woman is murdered at the country estate he’s visiting, he has to use his detective skills to catch the criminal. <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i> sets the stage for the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, and has everything you’d expect from a story rich in those classic detective fiction tropes.</p>\n\t\t",

He’s educated by his uncle before leaving to attend a university, but on the way his journey is interrupted by a band of robbers, and his picaresque adventures begin. Blas embarks on a series of jobs, challenges, advances, setbacks, romances, and fights on his path through life, ultimately continuing to rise in station thanks to his affability and quick wit. On his way he encounters many different kinds of people, both honest and dishonest, as well as many different social classes. Blas’ series of breezy, episodic adventures give <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alain-rene-lesage\">Lesage</a> an opportunity to satirize every stratum of society, from the poor, to doctors, the clergy, writers and playwrights, the rich, and even royalty.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though Lesage wrote in French, <i>Gil Blas</i> is ultimately a Spanish novel in nature: Blas himself is Spanish, and his adventures take place in Spain. The details Lesage wrote into the novel were so accurate that some accused him of lifting from earlier works, like <i>Marcos de Obregón</i> by Vicente Espinel; others even accuse it of being written by someone else, arguing that no Frenchman could know so much detail about Spanish life and society.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Despite any controversy, <i>Gil Blas</i> was translated into English by Tobias Smollett in 1748. His translation was so complete that it became the standard translation up to the modern day.</p>\n\t\t",

Along with <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anton-chekhov\">Chekhov</a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ivan-bunin\">Bunin</a>, he did much to draw attention away from the “great Russian novel” and to make short fiction popular. His work is famed for its descriptive qualities and sense of place, but it always centers on the souls of the stories’ subjects. The themes of his work are wide and varied, and include biblical parables, bittersweet romances, spy fiction, and farce, among many others. In 1920, under some political pressure, Kuprin left Russia for France, and his later work primarily adopts his new homeland for the setting.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This collection comprises the best individual translations into English of each of his short stories and novellas available in the public domain, presented in chronological order of their translated publication.</p>\n\t\t",

The women, subject to effective slavery through the removal of their papers and onerous debts, act out a scene of easy affability every evening for the part ignorant, part monstrous clients, while keeping secret their own pasts and wished-for futures.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book was <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aleksandr-kuprin\">Kuprin’s</a> attempt to denormalize the cultural ambiguity of the legal brothels of the time. His dedication—“to mothers and youths”—expresses his desire that there should no longer be a silent acceptance of the actions of the “fathers, husbands, and brothers.” The novel was notable for portraying the inhabitants of the brothels as living, breathing people with their own hopes and desires, not purely as a plot point or scenario.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The critical response was mixed: many found the subject matter beyond the pale. Kuprin himself placed his hopes on a favourable review from <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy\">Leo Tolstoy</a>, which didn’t come; but there was praise for <i lang=\"ru\">Yama</i> as both social commentary and warning, and an appreciation for Kuprin’s attempt to detail the everyday lives of his subjects.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel had a troubled genesis, with the first part taking nine years between initial proposal and first publication; the second and third parts followed five years later. It was a victim of the Russian censors who, tellingly, disapproved more of scenes involving officials visiting the brothels, than the brothels themselves. It was only later during preparations for an anthology of his work that an uncensored version was allowed to be released. This edition is based on the translation to English by Bernard Guilbert Guerney of that uncensored version, and was first published in 1922.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>In early 1787, the Congress of the United States called a meeting of delegates from each state to try to fix what was wrong with the Articles of Confederation. The Articles had created an intentionally weak central government, and that weakness had brought the nation to a crisis in only a few years. Over the next several months, the delegates worked to produce the document that would become the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>When Congress released the proposed Constitution to the states for ratification in the fall of 1787, reaction was swift: in newspapers throughout each state, columnists were quick to condemn the radical reworking of the nation’s formative document. In New York State, a member of the convention decided to launch into the fray; he and two other men he recruited began writing their own anonymous series defending the proposed Constitution, each one signed “Publius.” They published seventy-seven articles in four different New York papers over the course of several months. When the articles were collected and published as a book early the following year, the authors added another eight articles. Although many at the time guessed the true identities of the authors, it would be a few years before the authors were confirmed to be <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexander-hamilton_john-jay_james-madison\">Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay</a>, Hamilton and Madison both being delegates at the convention.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Although the articles’ influence on the Constitution’s ratification is debated—newspapers were largely local at the time, so few outside New York saw the articles—their influence on the interpretation of the Constitution within the judiciary is immense. They are a window not only into the structure and content of the document, but also the <em>reasons</em> for the structure and content, written by men who helped author the document. Consequently, they have been quoted almost 300 times in Supreme Court cases. They remain perhaps the best and clearest explanation of the document that is the cornerstone of the United States government.</p>\n\t\t",

In his journals he details two separate voyages: one up what is now known as the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean in 1789, and another to what is now Bella Coola on the Pacific Ocean in 1792 and 1793.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Both journals provide a detailed description of the many difficulties in navigating and traveling in a country that had yet to be mapped. Having to rely on Native guides and rumors, and enduring hardships that almost beggar belief, Mackenzie and his team were able to achieve their objective of finding an east to west land crossing through the Rocky Mountains and to the Pacific Ocean. Although his route didn’t prove as practical as routes found by later explorers, Mackenzie has cemented himself as a key explorer of Western Canada.</p>\n\t\t",

The version of the stories as collected here follows the final selection and revisions made by Bierce for his <i>Collected Works, Volume 2</i>, published in 1909, and is broken up into two sections, “Soldiers” and “Civilians.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Bierce fought for the Union in the American Civil War from the very first organized action at Philippi. He went on to fight in some of the deadliest battles of the war, at Shiloh and Chickamauga. He joined Sherman’s army on its march to Atlanta, and was grievously wounded in the head at Kennesaw Mountain. These locations serve as backdrops in his gritty and realist short stories in the “Soldiers” collection, most especially in the surreal story “Chickamauga.” While these stories are set in the war, Bierce covers a wide range of themes, from the fear of death in “Parker Adderson, Philosopher,” the requirements of duty for a soldier in “A Horseman in the Sky,” and what one might do for love in “Killed at Resaca.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Perhaps the most well-known story in “Soldiers” is “An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.” Kurt Vonnegut called it “the greatest American short story,” saying “It is a flawless example of American genius, like ‘Sophisticated Lady’ by Duke Ellington or the Franklin stove.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Bierce, much like <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe\">Edgar Allan Poe</a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft\">H. P. Lovecraft</a>, was an American pioneer in what he called his “tall tales”—psychological, supernatural, grotesque, and horror fiction. Many stories in “Civilians,” such as “The Man and the Snake,” “A Holy Terror,” and “The Suitable Surroundings,” foreshadow his later and darker works as studies in psychological horror. “The Eyes of the Panther” is a tragic, near-supernatural (though the reader is left guessing) tale of a woman of “feline beauty” and the man seeking her hand. Other stories found in the collection are satirical and ironic, like “The Famous Gilson Bequest” and “The Applicant.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Bierce’s writing earned him the title “Bitter Bierce” from his contemporaries, as one finds precious little hope and compassion in his stories, with death—often cruel—a recurring theme. A very rare exception can be found in “A Lady from Redhorse,” an epistolary romance.</p>\n\t\t",

His bitter cynicism on human nature is exemplified in “Montefiore,” “Incurable,” and “The Man Born Blind.” Echoes of the American Civil War, in which Bierce fought for the Union, appear in works such as “At a ‘National Encampment,’ ” “The Death of Grant,” and “The Hesitating Veteran.” Religion is not spared, and he addresses it in “The Lord’s Prayer on a Coin,” “Religion,” and “Theosophistry.” He even wrote several short satirical dramas in verse, addressing, among other topics, Prohibition (“Metempsychosis”), the railroads (“The Birth of the Rail”), and Chinese expulsion in California (“ ‘Peaceful Expulsion’ ”). His poems such as “A Vision of Doom,” “Avalon,” “The Passing Show,” and “Invocation” (one of his most well-known poems) capture his metaphysical outlook and pessimism. He even pens a fine elegy to his cat in “In Memoriam.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This comprehensive collection contains much of Bierce’s poetical work from multiple sources: his early poems and epigrams published in <i>The Fiend’s Delight</i> under his pseudonym “Dod Grile”; his poetry collections <i>Shapes of Clay</i> and <i>Black Beetles in Amber</i>, as edited and revised by him in his <i>Collected Works</i>; his various “ante-mortem” epitaphs on individuals who had not yet died (“On Stone”); his collection of hundreds of epigrams, also published in his <i>Collected Works</i>; and several uncollected poems, published in various newspapers.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>“<b>Dictionary</b><em>, n</em>: A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ambrose-bierce\">Bierce’s</a> groundbreaking <i>Devil’s Dictionary</i> had a complex publication history. Started in the mid-1800s as an irregular column in Californian newspapers under various titles, he gradually refined the new-at-the-time idea of an irreverent set of glossary-like definitions. The final name, as we see it titled in this work, did not appear until an 1881 column published in the periodical <i>The San Francisco Illustrated Wasp</i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>There were no publications of the complete glossary in the 1800s. Not until 1906 did a portion of Bierce’s collection get published by Doubleday, under the name <i>The Cynic’s Word Book</i>—the publisher not wanting to use the word “Devil” in the title, to the great disappointment of the author. The 1906 word book only went from A to L, however, and the remainder was never released under the compromised title.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In 1911 the <i>Devil’s Dictionary</i> as we know it was published in complete form as part of Bierce’s collected works (volume 7 of 12), including the remainder of the definitions from M to Z. It has been republished a number of times, including more recent efforts where older definitions from his columns that never made it into the original book were included. Due to the complex nature of copyright, some of those found definitions have unclear public domain status and were not included. This edition of the book includes, however, a set of definitions attributed to his one-and-only “Demon’s Dictionary” column, including Bierce’s classic definition of A: “the first letter in every properly constructed alphabet.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Bierce enjoyed “quoting” his pseudonyms in his work. Most of the poetry, dramatic scenes and stories in this book attributed to others were self-authored and do not exist outside of this work. This includes the prolific <em>Father Gassalasca Jape</em>, whom he thanks in the preface—“jape” of course having the definition: “a practical joke.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This book is a product of its time and must be approached as such. Many of the definitions hold up well today, but some might be considered less palatable by modern readers. Regardless, the book’s humorous style is a valuable snapshot of American culture from past centuries.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>It’s the roaring 20s, and a young flapper named Lorelei decides to keep a diary after receiving a blank journal from a “gentleman friend.” She has an apartment in New York paid for by a Chicago businessman named Gus Eisman; when he’s in town, Mr. Eisman spends his time “educating” Lorelei by going out to dinner, taking in shows, and then escorting her to her apartment to “talk about the topics of the day until quite late.” When he’s away, Lorelei does much the same with the other men she has charmed.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Joined by her best friend Dorothy, Lorelei embarks on a cruise to Europe in order to meet Mr. Eisman in Paris and continue her education. As the diary unfolds, we learn more about Lorelei’s past and her cynical, rather mercenary approach towards romance, all set in a light, funny, and very charming atmosphere.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Originally published as a series of sketches known as “the Lorelei stories” in <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i>, <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i> was published as a novel in 1925. Despite lukewarm initial reviews, it quickly became a success, becoming the second-best seller of 1926. Since then it has gone on to be an international bestseller, having been printed in over eighty-five editions and adapted several times—most famously as the 1953 film starring Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edith-wharton\">Edith Wharton</a> called it “the great American novel,” and it has garnered praise from many authors including <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce\">James Joyce</a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald\">F.

Thomas Carlyle considered it “a precious national possession, recovered after six centuries of neglect, [which] takes undisputed place among the sacred books of German literature.” Due to a lack of interest in copying the manuscripts, the work was forgotten, only faintly remembered as an influence in other German writing. Today, a total of 36 manuscripts have been unearthed. Many of these are only poem fragments, but three manuscripts have been viewed as the most complete and authentic versions to exist: these manuscripts are referred to as “A,” “B,” and “C.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>“A” follows most of the original written forms, but is the shortest manuscript of the three. “C” is the most altered edition, as it was changed to suit later cultural tastes. Manuscript “B” is considered the gold standard since it shows signs of minimal alterations and is of intermediate length. Alice Horton has used manuscript “B” as the foundation of her English edition, creating a work that is accurate in translation and with its lyrical quality preserved. It portrays an epic adventure that grabs and holds the reader’s attention.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Siegfried, the knighted prince of Netherland, has plans to marry the beautiful Princess Kriemhilda of Burgundy. He visits Worms to bargain with the three kings and Kriemhilda’s brothers: Gunther, Gernot, and Giselher.

To marry their sister and receive her wealth, Siegfried must convince the ruler beyond the sea and the mighty maiden warrior to be Gunther’s wife.

Labeled a ne’er-do-well by his sister-in-law, young Rudolph determines to escape his family and secretly travel to Ruritania for the coronation of his distant relative.

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>Can You Forgive Her?</i> is the story of Alice Vavasor and her cousins. On her father’s side are Kate and George Vavasor, brother and sister. Alice and George had been passionately in love, but flaws in George’s character led her to break an engagement with him. As time passes, she falls in love with John Grey, and agrees to be his wife—but his placid character leaves her longing for something of the excitement of her previous lover. This engagement, too, is broken, in part through Kate’s efforts to bring Alice and George back together. But on Alice’s mother’s side, she is also cousin to Lady Glencora Palliser, recently married to Plantagenet Palliser, nephew and heir to the Duke of Omnium, and a rising man in Parliament. As Lady Glencora learns to look to Alice for support in the rocky early days of marriage, Alice herself is thrown into deeper doubt about the wisdom of her own choices.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Can You Forgive Her?</i> is the first in the series of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope\">Anthony Trollope’s</a> political novels, known collectively as the <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/palliser\">Palliser novels</a>. They serve in many ways to extend his earlier <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/chronicles-of-barsetshire\">Chronicles of Barsetshire</a>: the Palliser family is already introduced there, especially in <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope/doctor-thorne\">Doctor Thorne</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope/the-small-house-at-allington\">The Small House at Allington</a></i>. In fact, Trollope completed this, the first of his “parliamentary” novels, in 1864, before embarking on <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope/the-last-chronicle-of-barset\">The Last Chronicle of Barset</a></i> in 1866.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While the Barchester books have the intrigues of provincial clergy and cathedral as their focal point, the Palliser series moves on to the high politics of parliament and Westminster. And much as the interest in clerical life ebbs and flows in the Barchester series, so too politics comes into prominence and recedes through the Palliser novels.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In <i>Can You Forgive Her?</i>, political aspiration is present throughout, though personal politics comes in for closer scrutiny than the parliamentary variety. The exploration of whether others can forgive Alice parallels the need for almost every other character in the novel to be forgiven for something by someone. Trollope also examines the question of whether Alice can forgive herself, or receive the forgiveness of others—and he pointedly invites the “gentle reader” to reflect on their own preparedness to forgive.</p>\n\t\t",

A will is made in favor of the nephew, following the squire’s sense of duty. But during the young man’s visit to the estate, the squire’s revulsion makes him produce a new will in favor of his niece. After his funeral, the earlier will is found among his papers, but not the later one. Cousin Henry takes his place as the new squire under a cloud, and worse—as it transpires that, unknown to anyone else, he alone knows where the later will is hidden. Too weak to destroy the will, and too greedy to disclose its existence, he descends into misery as the lawyers close in.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope\">Anthony Trollope’s</a> later fiction is marked by his keen interest in the psychology of his characters, what Michael Sadleir called his “novels of the mind.” In <i>Cousin Henry</i>, the plot is simple, but the psychological is paramount. The inner life of each of the leading characters is laid bare under Trollope’s pen: not only the unfortunate Cousin Henry, but equally his proud and imperious rival, Isabel, and the indefatigable lawyer, Mr. Apjohn.</p>\n\t\t",

After he and his wife Fanny take up residence in Framley Parsonage, Robarts is led into the society of some loose-living aristocrats through his friendship with Ludovic. Robarts eventually finds himself weakly consenting to his name being included on a bill for a loan to one of his new connections, Sowerby. By so doing, he becomes liable for debts he cannot possibly satisfy.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>An important secondary thread involves Mark Robarts’ sister Lucy, who after their father’s death comes to live with her brother’s family at the parsonage. Through them, she becomes acquainted with Lady Lufton and her son Ludovic, and romantic complications ensue.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Framley Parsonage</i> was originally published anonymously in serial form in <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, and such was its popularity that during its publication a hysterical young woman apparently tried to gain notoriety in her country town by claiming to be its author. “The real writer,” we are told, “dealt very gently with the pretender.”</p>\n\t\t",

As Christmas approaches, the conditions for his ruin arise naturally in the intense, scorching heat of a southern hemisphere summer.

Although training for the Bar, he feels the lure of Parliament and manages to secure a seat. Blessed with good fortune, “comely inside and out,” and pleasant company to both women and men, he begins to climb the ladder. Along with his undoubted triumphs there come also palpable failures—social as well as political. Leaving behind a sweetheart in Ireland, he encounters women of high status and fashion in London who place their own claims on his heart.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While Phineas is clearly the hero of the novel bearing his name, the lives of a number of remarkable women become intertwined with his own, each of whom he loves, after a fashion. The portrait of Lady Laura Standish—who serves as his political muse as well—is especially poignantly drawn, while Violet Effingham and the somewhat mysterious Madame Max Goesler each have an individuated strength and depth of character. Each, too, mirrors in different ways the dilemma faced by Phineas in his political career: whether it is better to be subservient and “succeed,” or maintain independence and risk being an outcast.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The writing of <i>Phineas Finn</i> coincided with Trollope’s own political awakening and aspirations. While working on this novel, he was also composing a memoir of Lord Palmerston, the Prime Minister who had died in office only a couple years previously. (The memoir remained unpublished until 1882.) By this point in his mid fifties, Trollope made his own attempt to secure a seat as a member of Parliament in 1868, failed, and was scarred by the experience. The literary critic Michael Sadleir characterized Trollope’s parliamentary fiction as showing a “preoccupation with political society [but] indifference to political theory,” perhaps unfairly. Especially in the character of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Monk, Phineas’s chief political mentor, much wisdom for parliamentary life is imparted.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Trollope’s political failure does not yet cast a shadow on the optimism which pervades <i>Phineas Finn</i>. The novelist’s own views would ripen along with those of his characters as the series took shape. Still, in his autobiography Trollope was able to declare, “<i>Phineas Finn</i>, I certainly think, was successful from first to last.”</p>\n\t\t",

On closer inspection, she turns out also to be a “nasty, low, scheming, ill-conducted, dishonest little wretch.” Her calculated marriage to a wealthy but sickly young baronet brought her the wealth she desired, including a spectacular diamond necklace which she wore in the days before her husband’s demise. Upon his death, the lawyer for the estate is determined to recover it as a family heirloom. The young widow is equally determined to keep it as her own.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But just as Lizzie sought a life of ease by marrying money, so too there are those who see in Lady Eustace their opportunity to acquire riches along with the beautiful widow herself. Given the relentless, even fierce, legal forces she faces regarding the diamonds, Lizzie is also alert to the benefit she would enjoy from having a husband to support her. But which is it to be? The tedious Lord Fawn, who would bring a title? Her cousin and confidant, Frank Greystock, who is a member of Parliament but saddled with debt? Or the debonair but dubious Lord George de Bruce Carruthers? Or perhaps none of them!</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Lizzie’s life of lies and calculation has echoes and mirrors in the novel’s subplots. She falls in with an unsavory and scheming set which includes a desperately ill-suited couple being driven towards a potentially disastrous marriage. Meanwhile, the love life of her childhood friend, the plain, poor, and pure Lucy Morris, seems to be the antithesis to Lizzie’s own.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope\">Anthony Trollope</a> felt real ambivalence about the growing interest in mystery novels, whose popularity was burgeoning as he sat down to write <i>The Eustace Diamonds</i>. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins\">Wilkie Collins’s</a> <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone\">The Moonstone</a></i> had just been published to huge success, giving birth to the detective novel genre. Trollope would have none of it, and kept no secrets from his readers. That <i>The Eustace Diamonds</i> maintains a sense of drama and intrigue in spite of Trollope’s forthright narration is a testament to his skill as a storyteller.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>There are also signs of Trollope plotting a future course for his <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/palliser\">Palliser series</a>, of which <i>The Eustace Diamonds</i> is the third. Political life is not absent, but it is wholly subservient to the events that swirl around Lizzie and her companions.

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Small House at Allington</i> was originally serialized in <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> between July and December 1862. It is the fifth book in <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/anthony-trollope\">Trollope’s</a> <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/chronicles-of-barsetshire\">Chronicles of Barsetshire</a> series, being largely set in that fictious county of England. It includes a few of the characters from the earlier books, though largely in very minor roles. It could also be said to be the first of Trollope’s Palliser series, as it introduces Plantagenet Palliser as the heir to the Duke of Omnium.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The major story, however, relates to the inhabitants of the Small House at the manor of Allington. The Small House was once the Dower House of the estate (a household where the widowed mother of the squire might live, away from the Great House). Now living there, however, is Mary Dale, the widow of the squire’s brother, and her two daughters, Isabella (Bell) and Lilian (Lily). The main focus of the novel is on Lily Dale, who is courted by Adolphus Crosbie, a friend of the squire’s nephew. In a matter of a few weeks, Lily falls deeply in love with Crosbie, who quickly proposes to her and is accepted. A few weeks later, however, Crosbie is visiting Courcy Castle and decides an alliance with the Earl’s daughter Alexandrina would be far preferable from a social and monetary point of view. Without speaking to Lily, he abruptly changes his plans and asks Alexandrina to marry him instead. This act of betrayal is devastating to Lily and her family.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This novel, along with the other titles in the Barsetshire series, was turned into a radio play for Radio 4 in the United Kingdom in the late 1990s. The British Prime Minister John Major was recorded in the 1990s as saying that <i>The Small House at Allington</i> was his favorite book.</p>\n\t\t",

Chekhov was a firm believer that the role of the artist was to correctly pose a question, but not necessarily to answer it.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This collection contains all of his short stories and two novellas, all translated by Constance Garnett, and arranged by the date they were originally published.</p>\n\t\t",

He eats less and less with every day, keeps his young servant Elsie working long hours for minimal pay, and never lights a candle when darkness will do.

Instead, it reflects the pain and disappointment of the years immediately following the Great War. As Earlforward tells a customer early on, “We’re not quite straight here yet.

Even when the two Baines daughters were still young, their characters are already formed.

While still in her teens, the headstrong Sophia elopes with a traveling salesman, leaving England’s provinces for Paris. Constance, who later marries the head employee at the store, hardly ever leaves their town—or even the square where their shop is located. As the novelist <abbr>J.

It was published in 1887 in a popular magazine, <i>Beeton’s Christmas Annual</i>.

In precarious health and even more precarious financial straits, he’s looking for cheap lodgings when a friend introduces him to Sherlock Holmes. The pair agree to share the rent of a flat Holmes has found.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Watson is baffled by his companion’s strange nature, his peculiar interests, his unusual breadth of knowledge in certain fields alongside his shocking ignorance in others, and his many strange visitors. Only eventually does Watsonb discover that Holmes has set himself up as the world’s first “consulting detective,” and it’s not long before Watson finds himself assisting Holmes in a mysterious case. The body of a man has been found in an abandoned house, without wounds or other marks of injury. But on the wall, scrawled in blood, is the word RACHE.

Holmes, alongside his friend and biographer <abbr>Dr.</abbr> John Watson, appeared in two initial novels and dozens of short stories serialized in popular magazines, attracting a devoted, almost fanatical following which continues to this day.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>, serialized in 1901–1902, was the third novel featuring Holmes and Watson. Sherlock Holmes is consulted in his Baker Street apartment by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Mortimer, a physician now living on the fringes of Dartmoor. He gives Holmes and Watson an account of a centuries-old legend, in which a hell-hound slaughtered the debauched heir of the Baskerville family who had been in lecherous pursuit of an innocent maiden across the moor. The same hound is reputed to have harrowed several of the subsequent heirs to the estate.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This ancient story might be dismissed as mere fancy, but for the fact that the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville recently died in very mysterious circumstances, apparently fleeing in terror from something which came from the moor. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Mortimer is concerned that the new heir, Sir Henry, just returned from Canada, may be at risk from this supernatural beast. Holmes is intrigued, but being too busy to go himself, sends <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Watson to accompany Sir Henry to the ancestral home on Dartmoor and to report anything suspicious.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> is arguably the best, and certainly the most popular, of Doyle’s novels featuring his iconic detective. It has been translated into almost every language in the world and been the basis of dozens of movies (starting as early as 1914), radio plays and comic books.</p>\n\t\t",

All of the stories included in the collection previously appeared in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> between 1892 and 1893. They purport to be the accounts given by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> John Watson of the more remarkable cases in which his friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sherlock Holmes becomes involved in his role as a consulting detective.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This collection has several memorable features. The first British edition omitted the story “The Adventure of the Cardboard Box” which appeared in <i>The Strand</i> in 1893. This story did appear in the very first American edition of the collection, immediately following “Silver Blaze,” but it was quickly replaced by a revised edition which omitted it. Apparently these omissions were at the specific request of the author, who was concerned that its inclusion of the theme of adultery would make it unsuitable for younger readers. The story was, however, eventually included in the later collection <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/his-last-bow\"><i>His Last Bow</i></a>, but it is out of chronological position there. In this Standard Ebooks edition (as in most modern British editions), we have included this story to restore it to its correct chronological place in the Holmes canon.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i> is also notable because by this time <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle\">Doyle</a> had tired of the Holmes character and decided to kill him off, so that this was intended to be the last Holmes collection ever to be published. It contains several of the best-known Holmes stories, including “Silver Blaze,” “The Musgrave Ritual,” and “The Greek Interpreter,” which introduces Sherlock’s brother Mycroft; and of course “The Final Problem” in which Holmes struggles with his nemesis Professor Moriarty.</p>\n\t\t",

He has never been seen or heard of ever since. But a few years after his disappearance, Miss Morstan was startled to receive a precious pearl in the mail, with no sender’s name or address and no accompanying message. A similar pearl has arrived each subsequent year. Finally, she received an anonymous letter begging her to come to a meeting outside a London theater that very evening. She may bring two companions. Naturally, Holmes and Watson accompany the young woman to the mysterious meeting, and are subsequently involved in the unveiling of a complex story of treasure and betrayal.</p>\n\t\t",

While his body of work is wide, he’s perhaps best known for his supernaturally-flavored proto-horror short stories. <i>The Great God Pan</i>—perhaps his most famous work—along with “The Inmost Light” and <i>The White People</i> deeply influenced later writers like <abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft. Stephen King has gone so far as to call <i>The Great God Pan</i> “maybe the best [horror story] in the English language.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Besides his horror short stories, Machen also wrote a handful of post World War I supernatural shorts. One of these, “The Bowmen,” was published in a popular newspaper and was implied to be non-fiction, leading to the creation of the “Angels of Mons” urban legend. This collection includes several other World War I short stories published by Machen.</p>\n\t\t",

Machen was inspired by a review of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/laurence-sterne/the-life-and-opinions-of-tristram-shandy-gentleman\"><i>Tristram Shandy</i></a> that described it as “a picaresque of the mind,” and determined to write “a <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/daniel-defoe/the-life-and-adventures-of-robinson-crusoe\"><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></a> of the soul.” The protagonist’s isolation from the rest of society certainly resonates with that description.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Machen wrote this ten years earlier than its original 1907 publication, it having been turned down by the publishers of the time. While it was mostly ignored on its initial release, it has picked up admirers over the years and is now viewed as one of Machen’s most important works.</p>\n\t\t",

But while it was regarded as shocking, it ran well and made a substantial profit. Theatre historian <abbr>J.

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/auguste-comte\">Auguste Comte</a>, considered by some to be the first “philosopher of science,” was perhaps most famous for founding the theory of Positivism: a framework of thinking and living meant to engender unity across humanity, backed by love, science, and intellect.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Positivism itself is a combination philosophy and way of life. Here Comte lays down the various tenets of the philosophy, describing what he views as the six major characteristics of the system. Comte goes into surprising detail, going so far as to describe minutiae like how children should be educated, the structure of a unified global committee of nations, new flags, calendars, the role of the arts, and so on. He ends the book with what he calls the “Religion of Humanity,” a secular religion meant to replace the traditional religions that people of the time were becoming disillusioned with.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book and the theory are both very much products of the time. Comte was born around the end of the French Revolution, and lived in Paris during that time when republican ideas, respect for science, and a revolutionary and forward-thinking spirit made fertile ground for change. He viewed Positivism as the single solution to most of the problems of the day, including Communism, the plight of the working class, the shift away from traditional religion, and the constant war and strife that had plagued humanity.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Comte’s theories gained a huge following: you might even recognize the Positivist motto, “Order and Progress,” inscribed on Brazil’s national flag. While Positivism and its executive arm, the Church of Humanity, today only seem to survive in any significant number in Brazil—and even there in a greatly declined state—its theories were hugely influential in the emergence of many “ethical societies” and secular church movements around the globe.</p>\n\t\t",

It was eventually published nine years later in 1902 as “The Tale of Peter Rabbit,” accompanied by her watercolor illustrations. Its success led to the publishing of a further twenty-two books in the series over the next three decades.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The creatures detailed lead period-correct lives, with many of them having jobs in the animal society that mimic the society Beatrix was living in. Her stories rarely shy away from showing the dangers of the wider world that the inhabitants find themselves in, and similarly they rarely end on a completely happy note. But despite this—or perhaps because of this—they have remained globally popular over the last century with both children and parents alike. The stories have been translated many times over, and continue to be presented in new formats including <abbr>TV</abbr>, film, theater, and even ballet.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The success of her books and the associated licensing deals allowed Beatrix Potter to purchase large tracts of land in the Lake District, which later became part of the new British National Parks system. Her love of nature and the locality led her to fell farming and other local traditions, and she was even able to use her skills with watercolors to scientifically document the fungi of the area.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This collection comprises the twenty-two “Tale” books in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> public domain.</p>\n\t\t",

Jonson uses the play to satirize as many people as he can—pompous lords, greedy commoners, and self-righteous Anabaptists alike—as his three con artists proceed to bilk everyone who comes to their door. They don multiple roles and weave elaborate tales to exploit their victims’ greed and amass a small fortune. But it all comes to a sudden, raucous end when the master unexpectedly returns to London and all the victims gather to try and reclaim their property.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/benjamin-disraeli\">Benjamin Disraeli</a> was a remarkable historical figure. Born into a Jewish family, he converted to Anglican Christianity as a child. He is now almost certainly most famous for his political career. Becoming a member of the British Parliament at the age of 33, he initially rose to prominence within the Conservative (“Tory”) party because of his clashes with the then Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. Rising to lead the Conservative Party, Disraeli became Prime Minister for a short period in 1868, and then for an extended period between 1874 and 1880. He became friendly with Queen Victoria and was appointed Earl of Beaconsfield by her in 1876.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>However, Disraeli was much more than a politician. He wrote both political treatises and no less than seventeen novels during his lifetime, of which <i>Sybil, or The Two Nations</i> is now among the best regarded. The “Two Nations” of the subtitle refer to the divisions in Britain between the rich and the poor, each of whom might as well be living in a different country from the other. In the novel, Disraeli highlights the terrible living conditions of the poor and the shocking injustices of how they were treated by most employers and land-owners. He contrasts this with the frivolous, pampered lifestyles of the aristocracy. He covers the rise of the Chartist movement, which was demanding universal manhood suffrage—the right for all adult men to vote, regardless of whether they owned property—and other reforms to enable working men a voice in the government of the country. (Female suffrage was to come much later). The upheavals of the time led to the development of the People’s Charter and a massive petition with millions of signatures being presented to Parliament. However the Parliament of the time refused to even consider the petition, triggering violent protests in Birmingham and elsewhere. All of this is well covered and explained in the novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Sybil</i> is rather disjointed in structure as it ranges over these different topics, but the main plot revolves around Egremont, the younger son of a nobleman, who encounters some of the leaders of the workers’ movement and in particular Walter Gerard, one of the most respected of these leaders, whom Egremont befriends while concealing his real name and social position. During visits to Gerard under an assumed name, Egremont falls for the beautiful and saintly Sybil, Gerard’s daughter, but she rejects him when his true identity is exposed. Sybil subsequently undergoes many difficult trials as the people’s movement develops and comes into conflict with the authorities.</p>\n\t\t",

He wore many hats over the course of his fascinating life, from that of a printer, to an inventor, to a scientist, to a politician, a founding father and statesman, and even a postmaster-general. He was famous for all of these things in his day, but he was also famed for his keen insight into people and human nature, and his sparkling talent as a conversationalist.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Despite his accomplishments, Franklin seemed to keep a down-to-earth demeanor, favoring home-spun sayings and simple, direct, honest prose—the kind of prose that shines in this autobiography.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The autobiography itself has a long and complex publication history. Franklin composed it in fits and spurts between 1771 and 1790, and never had a chance to complete it, let alone publish it, in his lifetime. It was first published as a poor French translation of an unrevised edition of the manuscript, and then as a heavily-editorialized and inaccurate English edition by Franklin’s son, William Temple Franklin. In 1868 John Bigelow purchased the original copy of the autobiography and published the first accurate edition, which is what subsequent publications, including this one, are based on.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though incomplete, this autobiography is a highly readable and fascinating insight into the legendary life of the man some people call the “First American.”</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/black-hawk\">Black Hawk</a>, so named after the sacred medicine bag he carried with him, was a warrior and a leader of a tribe of Sauk Native Americans in the American Midwest circa 1800. He rose to leadership during a tumultuous time for his people, as they were pressed on all sides by the warlike British, the ruthlessly expansionist Americans, and the grudges and jealousies of neighboring tribes.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>He lived as a warrior for much of his early life, when the War of 1812 between the British and the Americans forced the Sauk to take sides and enter the fray. Angered by the Americans’ demands they sign shaky treaties to cede their land, the tribe fought for the British until the toll of the war forced the tribe to bow out.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After the war, Black Hawk signed a peace treaty with the Americans, but a series of misunderstandings once again brought tensions between the Sauk and the Americans to a head. When a group of under-trained Illinois militia mistakenly opened fire on the Sauk, Black Hawk began what is known as the Black Hawk War, leading raids against American forts and settlements in an effort to reclaim their ancient land.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Even though Black Hawk managed to convince other tribes to join his cause, the war was quickly lost and Black Hawk captured. He was then taken on a tour of the vast East Coast cities in an attempt to impress upon him America’s overwhelming might. Despite his status as a former enemy, he was treated with dignity and respect by his captors before they granted him a small house and plot of land in Iowa to live out the rest of his days.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>His autobiography was dictated to a translator, Antoine Le Clair, and written down by his amanuensis and publisher, J. B. Patterson. The story Black Hawk tells is a vivid one of life on the prairie, rich with tradition and meaning, but riven equally by war and bloodshed. As he reminisces about the bucolic life he and his ancestors once led and compares it with the hardships his people are facing, his sorrow becomes palpable; and as his days draw to a close, the reader sees that even to Black Hawk, the fate of his people appears inevitable.</p>\n\t\t",

Like the previous entries in the series, <i>National Avenue</i> addresses the rapid industrialization of small-town America at the turn of the century, and the socioeconomic changes that such change brings with it.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Dan Oliphant and his brother Harlan are the children of a wealthy small-town businessman. Harlan is a traditional upper-class man—affecting an accent, dressing for dinner, and contemplating beauty and culture—while Dan is boisterous and lively, eager to do big things. Dan sees the rise of industry in America’s east as a harbinger for his own Midwestern town, and sets his mind on building an industrial suburb, Ornaby Addition, next to his city’s downtown.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Dan’s idea is met with scorn and mockery from not only his family, but also his fellow townspeople. Dan persists nonetheless, and soon the town must contend with his dream becoming a reality: noisy cars, smoky factories, huge, unappealing buildings, and the destruction of nature and the environment become the new normal as Dan’s industrial dream is realized.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Where <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/booth-tarkington/the-turmoil\">The Turmoil</a></i> focuses on industrialization’s effect on art and culture, and <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/booth-tarkington/the-magnificent-ambersons\">The Magnificent Ambersons</a></i> focuses on industry’s destruction of family and of small-town life, <i>National Avenue</i> focuses on the men and women who actually bring that change about. Dan is portrayed sympathetically, but Tarkington makes it clear that his dreams and choices lead to a deeply unhappy family life and the ruination of the land around him. But can Dan really be faulted for his dream, or is industry inevitable, and inevitably destructive?</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>, winner of the 1919 Pulitzer prize, is considered by many to be <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/booth-tarkington\">Booth Tarkington’s</a> finest novel and an American classic. The story is set in the Midwest, where George, the spoiled and oblivious scion of an old-money family, must cope with their waning fortunes and the rise of industry barons in the automobile age.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>George’s antiheroic struggles with modernity encapsulate a greater theme of change and renewal—specifically, the very American notion of a small community exploding into a dark and dirty city virtually overnight by virtue of industrial “progress.” Tarkington’s nuanced portrayal of the often-unlikable Amberson family and his paradoxical framing of progress as a destroyer of family, community, and environment, make <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> a fascinating and forward-thinking novel—certainly one with a permanent place in the American social canon. Despite the often heavy themes, Tarkington’s prose remains uniquely witty, charming, and brisk.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is the second in Tarkington’s <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/growth-trilogy\">Growth trilogy</a> of novels, and has been adapted several times for radio, film, and television, including a 1942 Orson Welles adaptation that many consider one of the finest American films ever made.</p>\n\t\t",

He was a contemporary of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells\"><abbr>H. G.</abbr> Wells</a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jules-verne\">Jules Verne</a>, though his works never achieved their level of popularity.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Omega: The Last Days of the World</i> is an English translation of Flammarion’s novel <i lang=\"fr\">La Fin du Monde</i>, published in 1893. The book’s fictional premise is the discovery of a comet on a collision course with the Earth in the 25th century. However, this is mostly a pretext on which Flammarion can hang his interesting scientific speculations about how the world will end, together with philosophical thoughts about war and religion. Much of the scientific description he uses in the book, while accurately representing the knowledge and thinking of his time, has today been superseded by modern discoveries. For example, we now know the source of the Sun’s energy to be nuclear fusion rather than being due to gravitational contraction and the constant infall of meteorites.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>When talking about the ills of society, however, Flammarion could well be talking about today’s world. For example, he excoriates the vast waste of society’s resources on war, and demonstrates how much more productive each nation’s economy would be without it. He also depicts the media of his future world as having been entirely taken over by commercial interests, publishing only what will excite the greatest number of readers rather than serving the public interest.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Omega</i> ranges over a vast period of time, from prehistory through to millions of years in the future when mankind has been reduced to the last two doomed individuals. Nevertheless, the book ends on a hopeful and inspiring note.</p>\n\t\t",

A mathematician by training, he also wrote copiously on subjects such as economics, physics, engineering, computation, cryptography, religion and education, along with conducting practical experiments with pretty much anything that had grabbed his interest at the time. Today, he’s widely viewed to be the father of the computer with his Difference and Analytical Engines.

Apart from his early life and an explanation of the thinking behind his computing Engines, Babbage also transcribes his memories of climbing into an active volcano, arguing with street musicians, picking locks, standing in elections, and imagining life as a cheese mite, among other diverse subjects. The original meaning of the titular word “Philosopher” is “lover of wisdom,” and this book shows Babbage to be just that.</p>\n\t\t",

Its full title is <i>The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</i>, in some editions prefaced by the word “On.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Darwin describes the book as simply an “abstract” of his ideas, which are more fully fleshed out and supported with detailed examples in his other, more scholarly works (for example, he wrote several long treatises entirely about barnacles). <i>The Origin of Species</i> itself was intended to reach a wider audience and is written in such a way that any reasonably educated and thoughtful reader can follow Darwin’s argument that species of animals and plants are not independent creations, fixed for all time, but mutable. Species have been shaped in response to the effects of natural selection, which Darwin compares to the directed or manual selection by human breeders of domesticated animals.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Origin of Species</i> was eagerly taken up by the reading public, and rapidly went through several editions.

A young woman discovers the father she’s never known is not dead but alive, if not entirely well. A young man is acquitted of being a traitor, due in part to the efforts of a rather selfish lout who is assisting the young man’s attorney. A man has a wine shop in Paris with a wife who knits at the bar. These disparate elements are tied together as only <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens\">Dickens</a> can, and in the process he tells the story of the French Revolution.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Charles Dickens was fascinated by <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-carlyle\">Thomas Carlyle’s</a> magnum opus <i>The French Revolution</i>; according to Dickens’ letters, he read it “500 times” and carried it with him everywhere while he was working on this novel. When he wrote to Carlyle asking him for books to read on background, Carlyle sent him two cartloads full. Dickens mimicked Carlyle’s style, his chronology, and his overall characterization of the revolution; although <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is fiction, the historical events described are largely accurate, sometimes exactly so. Even so, Dickens made his name and reputation on telling stories full of characters one could be invested in, care about, and despise, and this novel has all of those and more. It also, in its first and last lines, has two of the most famous lines in literature. With the possible exception of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/a-christmas-carol\"><i>A Christmas Carol</i></a>, it is his most popular novel, and according to many, his best.</p>\n\t\t",

Though very difficult to summarise, the novel centers around the decades-long legal case of <i>Jarndyce and Jarndyce</i>, involving the fair distribution of assets of a valuable estate. The case is mired in the legal quagmire of the Court of Chancery, whose byzantine and sluggish workings Dickens spares no effort to expose and condemn. Dickens also exposes the miserable condition of the poor, living in squalid, pestilential circumstances.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel’s heroine is Esther Summerson, whose parentage is unclear and who has been brought up by a cold and strict godmother, who tells her only: “Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.” On the death of her godmother, she is given an education through the unexpected intervention of a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jarndyce of Bleak House, whom she has never met. When she comes of age, she is appointed as a companion to Ada, one of two young people who are “wards of Chancery,” whose fates depend on the outcome of the legal struggle and who are taken into guardianship by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jarndyce. The other ward Richard, despite <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jarndyce’s frequent warnings, eventually goes astray by pinning all his hopes on a successful outcome of <i>Jarndyce and Jarndyce</i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>We are also introduced to Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, and to their cunning and suspicious lawyer, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Tulkinghorn. He uncovers evidence that Lady Dedlock is not all she seems and determines to remorselessly pursue every lead to expose her secrets.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel has a curious construction in that the first-person narrative of Esther, written in the past tense, is interleaved with many chapters written from the omniscient viewpoint and in the present tense.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Several prominent critics such as <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/g-k-chesterton\"><abbr>G. K.</abbr> Chesterton</a> consider <i>Bleak House</i> to be Dickens’ finest novel, and it is often ranked among the best English-language novels of all time.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>Hard Times</i> (originally <i>Hard Times—For These Times</i>) was published in 1854, and is the shortest novel <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens\">Charles Dickens</a> ever published. It’s set in Coketown, a fictional mill-town set in the north of England. One of the major themes of the book is the miserable treatment of workers in the mills, and the resistance to their unionization by the mill owners, typified by the character Josiah Bounderby, who absurdly asserts that the workers live a near-idyllic life but they all “expect to be set up in a coach and six, and to be fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon.” The truth, of course, is far different.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The other major topic which Dickens tackles in this novel is the rationalist movement in schooling and the denigration of imagination and fantasy. It begins with the words “Now, what I want is, Facts,” spoken by the wealthy magnate Thomas Gradgrind, who is supervising a class at a model school he has opened. This indeed is Gradgrind’s entire philosophy. “Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else.” He is supported and encouraged in this approach by his friend Bounderby. Grandgrind raises his own children on these principles, and, as we discover, in doing so blights their lives.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel also follows the story of a particular mill-worker, Stephen Blackpool, who leads a tragic life. He is burdened with an alcoholic, slatternly wife, who is mostly absent from his life, but who returns at irregular intervals to trouble him. This existing marriage, and the near-impossibility of divorce for someone of his class, prevents him marrying Rachael, who is the light of his life. Dickens depicts Stephen as representing the nobility of honest work, and contrasts his character with that of the self-satisfied humbug Josiah Bounderby who represents the worst aspects of capitalism.</p>\n\t\t",

After his father dies, Arthur returns home to London. His mother gives him little in the way of welcome. She is a cold, bitter woman who has brought Arthur up under a strict religious regime concentrating on the punitive aspects of the Old Testament. Despite this upbringing, or perhaps in reaction to it, Arthur is a kind, considerate man. He is intrigued by a slight young woman he encounters working as a part-time seamstress for his mother, whom his mother calls simply “Little Dorrit.” Arthur senses some mystery about her mother’s employment of Little Dorrit, and proceeds to investigate.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>There are several subplots and a whole host of characters. Compared to some of Dickens’ work, <i>Little Dorrit</i> features a good deal of intrigue and tension. There are also some strong strands of humor, in the form of the fictional “Circumlocution Office,” whose sole remit is “How Not To Do It,” and which stands in the way of any improvement of British life. Also very amusing are the rambling speeches of Flora, a woman with whom Arthur was enamored before he left for China, but whose shallowness he now perceives only too well.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Little Dorrit</i> has been adapted for the screen many times, and by the BBC in 2010 in a limited television series which featured Claire Foy as Little Dorrit, Matthew Macfayden as Arthur Clenham, and Andy Serkis as the villain Rigaud.</p>\n\t\t",

It details the misadventures of its eponymous character, Oliver Twist, born in a Victorian-era workhouse, his mother dying within minutes of his birth. He is raised in miserable conditions, half-starved, and then sent out as an apprentice to an undertaker. Running away from this situation, he walks to London and falls under the influence of a criminal gang run by an old man called Fagin, who wants to employ the child as a pickpocket.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel graphically depicts the wretched living conditions of much of the poor people of Victorian times and the disgusting slums in which they were forced to live. It has been accused of perpetrating anti-Semitic stereotypes in the character of Fagin, almost always referred to as “the Jew” in the book’s early chapters. Interestingly, while the serial was still running in the magazine, Dickens was eventually persuaded that he was wrong in this and removed many such usages in later episodes. He also introduced more kindly Jewish characters in such later novels as <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Oliver Twist</i> was immediately popular in serial form, with its often gripping story and lurid details. It has remained one of Dicken’s best-loved novels, and the story has often been made into films and television series, as well as into a very popular musical, <i>Oliver!</i>.</p>\n\t\t",

Each involves an element of magic, be it a vine that dooms those who eat from it or a man transformed into a tree to avoid being separated from his wife. Julius’s audience, a married couple who have just moved to the South to cultivate grapes, listen on with mixed sympathy and disbelief. They disagree on whether Julius is telling the truth and whether there is some deeper significance to the tales. At turns humorous and unsettling, these stories provide a surprising lens into the realities of slavery.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The text is notable for spelling out Julius’s spoken accent. Although Julius has some stereotypical features of a simple-minded old slave, he is often regarded as a more clever and complicated figure. He seems to tell his tales not only to entertain his listeners, but to trick them to his advantage.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Many of these stories first appeared in national magazines, where they received popular acclaim, before being assembled as their own volume in 1899. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-w-chesnutt\">Charles <abbr>W.</abbr> Chesnutt’s</a> race was not mentioned by the publisher, nor could many guess his African heritage based on his appearance.

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>Shirley</i>, published in 1849, was <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charlotte-bronte\">Charlotte Brontë’s</a> second novel after <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charlotte-bronte/jane-eyre\">Jane Eyre</a></i>. Published under her pseudonym of “Currer Bell,” it differs in several respects from that earlier work. It is written in the third person with an omniscient narrator, rather than the first-person of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and incorporates the themes of industrial change and the plight of unemployed workers. It also features strong pleas for the recognition of women’s intellect and right to their independence of thought and action.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Set in the West Riding of Yorkshire during the Napoleonic period of the early 19th Century, the novel describes the confrontations between textile manufacturers and organized groups of workers protesting the introduction of mechanical looms. Three characters stand out: Robert Moore, a mill-owner determined to introduce modern methods despite sometimes violent opposition; his young cousin Caroline Helstone, who falls deeply in love with Robert; and Shirley Keeldar, a rich heiress who comes to live in the estate of Fieldhead, on whose land Robert’s mill stands. Robert’s business is in trouble, not so much because of the protests of the workers but because of a government decree which prevents him selling his finished cloth overseas during the duration of the war with Napoleon. He receives a loan from Miss Keeldar, and her interest in him seems to be becoming a romantic one, much to the distress of Caroline, who pines away for lack of any sign of affection from Robert.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Shirley Keeldar is a remarkable female character for the time: strong, very independent-minded, dismissive of much of the standard rules of society, and determined to decide on her own future. Interestingly, up to this point, the name “Shirley” was almost entirely a male name; Shirley’s parents had hoped for a boy. Such was the success of Brontë’s novel, however, that it became increasingly popular as a female name and is now almost exclusively so.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Although never as popular or successful as the more classically romantic <i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>Shirley</i> is nevertheless now highly regarded by critics.</p>\n\t\t",

Gilman argues for the evolution of marriage, family, home life, and what she calls the sexuo-economic relationship between men and women.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Although she was in demand as a lecturer and writer, <i>Women and Economics</i> was the first book-length work to consolidate her views. As a feminist text, it’s significant not necessarily for its profundity or for its appeal for women’s rights, but rather for its application of social Darwinism, espousing the theory that the roles played by women inevitably evolve and that the gendered division of labor produces warped human beings of both sexes. Its popularity was also helped by its accessibility—as one of her critics stated, “it stirs no deep reverberations of the soul … but you can quote it, and remember its points.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As suffragism progressed and first wave feminism began to fade, Gilman’s ideas were somewhat forgotten. But as feminism resurged in the 1960s, her work was rediscovered and interest rebounded in this groundbreaking feminist who played an important role in shaping public opinion, disseminating radical ideas, and encouraging women (and men) to change their thinking about gender roles.</p>\n\t\t",

Many have critiqued it for its portrayal of Elizabethan antisemitism, but others argue that Marlowe criticizes Judaism, Islam, and Christianity equally for their hypocrisy. This antisemitism debate continues on to <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare\">Shakespeare’s</a> <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, which was written about ten years later and which some consider to be directly influenced by <i>The Jew of Malta</i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play focuses on a wealthy Jewish merchant named Barabas who lives on the island of Malta. When the island’s governor strips Barabas of all his wealth in order to pay off the invading Turks, Barabas plots and schemes to get his revenge, killing all who get in his way and ultimately pitting Spanish Christians against Ottoman Muslims in an attempt to punish them all.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Scholars dispute the authorship of the play, with some suggesting that the last half was written by a different author. Though the play is known to have been performed as early as 1594, the earliest surviving print edition is from 1633, which includes a prologue and epilogue written by another playwright for a planned revival.</p>\n\t\t",

It is believed to be the first dramatization of this classic tale wherein Faustus, a German scholar, trades his soul to Lucifer in return for magical powers and the command over the demon Mephistopheles. Faustus at first seeks to expand his knowledge of the universe, but soon finds that a deal with the devil brings little satisfaction. All too soon the contract expires, and Faustus is faced with the prospect of eternal damnation.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Two principal versions of this play exist, one based on the 1604 quarto (the A text) and a longer, emended version published in 1616 (the B text).

It went through various drafts, and was titled “Paul Morel” until the final draft, before being published and met with an indifferent reaction from contemporary critics. Modern critics now consider it to be <abbr>D. H.</abbr> Lawrence’s masterpiece, with the Modern Library placing it ninth in its “100 Best English-Language Novels of the 20th Century.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel follows the Morels, a family living in a coal town, and headed by a passionate but boorish miner. His wife, originally from a refined family, is dragged down by Morel’s classlessness, and finds her life’s joy in her children. As the children grow up and start leading lives of their own, they struggle against their mother’s emotional drain on them.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Sons and Lovers</i> was written during a period in Lawrence’s life when his own mother was gravely ill. Its exploration of the Oedipal instinct, frank depiction of working-class household unhappiness and violence, and accurate and colorful depiction of Nottinghamshire dialect, make it a fascinating window into the life of people not often chronicled in fiction of the day.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Rainbow</i> is an epic tale spanning three generations of Brangwens, a family of farmers living in Nottinghamshire around the time of the Industrial Revolution. The tale begins with Tom Brangwen, the very epitome of a rural English farmer leading the old way of life. We follow him as a youth easing in to the rhythm of rural existence. He soon falls in love with Lydia, a Polish immigrant he had hired as a housekeeper, and despite their vast cultural differences, the two marry. Their relationship is, in a word, satisfactory: the two face a language and culture barrier that prevents their minds from ever truly meeting, but they learn to be more or less content with their place in society and in raising their children.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Lydia’s child by her first marriage, Anna, becomes the focus of the next part of the novel. She was born in England, and has a fiery and demanding temperament. She falls in love with Will, a nephew of Tom, and the two begin a rocky and difficult marriage. Will, a craftsman and not a farmer, is self-absorbed, and wants nothing more than for them to live their lives only for each other. But Anna wants to strike out in the world and become a part of society. The two must reconcile their clashing personalities and desires as they raise their many children.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The oldest of their children, Ursula, becomes the focus of the last third—and perhaps most famous—part of the novel. Ursula is a deeply sensual being born in to the Victorian era, a time restrained in morality but exploding in energy and possibility, now worlds away from her grandfather Tom Brangwen’s quiet, traditional farming life. She leads a life unimaginable to her rural ancestors: indulging in travel abroad, waiting for marriage and pursuing her physical desires, and even taking on a career—a concept both new and frightening to her family, who are just a generation removed from the era when a woman’s life was led at home. Her unhappiness with the contradiction in this new unbridled way of living and the strict social mores of the era becomes the main theme of this last part of the book.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The entire novel takes a frank approach to sexuality and physical desire, with sex portrayed unashamedly as a natural, powerful, pleasurable, and desirable force in relationships. In fact Ursula’s story is the most famous part of the novel not just because of her unrestrained physicality and lust, but because she also experiments with a candidly-realized homosexual affair with one of her teachers. This unheard-of treatment of deeply taboo topics was poorly received by <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/d-h-lawrence\">Lawrence’s</a> Edwardian contemporaries, and the book quickly became the subject of an obscenity trial that resulted in over 1,000 copies being burned and the book being banned in the U.K. for eleven years.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though its charged portrayal of sexuality is what the book is remembered for, sexuality is only one of the themes Lawrence treats. The novel stands solidly on its rich description of both rural and city life, its wide-angled view of change over generations, and its exploration of hope for the human spirit in societies that heave not gently but quickly and violently into new eras.</p>\n\t\t",

As an adult, she found the manuscript along with other childhood writings and showed them to her literary friends for a laugh. They were so delighted that they passed them around their circle. The unexpected result was a publishing deal, with <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-m-barrie\"><abbr>J. M.</abbr> Barrie</a>, creator of Peter Pan, writing the preface. So clever was the book that some assumed Barrie himself had written the entire thing as an elaborate hoax.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The story’s “hero” is Alfred Salteena, a polite but bumbling man who hopes to learn the ways of the elite. He is in love with a younger woman, Ethel, but a love triangle with his friend Bernard soon emerges. The characters attend “sumshious” balls, stay in lavish “compartments,” and wear elaborate “get ups,” all of it rendered in Ashford’s original childish spelling. The story reads like a pastiche of high society and even a parody of the Victorian novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Young Visiters</i> was published in 1919 and was reprinted eighteen times in that year alone. It has been adapted into a play, a musical, and multiple film versions. Ashford’s other juvenile writings were later published, including <i>The Hangman’s Daughter</i>, a short novel she considered her finest work. As an adult, she did not continue to write.</p>\n\t\t",

Defoe derides quack doctors who killed more than they saved, and then themselves succumbed to plague. He tells of people turning to religion; of people driven mad by the death around them and raving in the streets; of people fleeing to the country, and of others barricading themselves in their homes. The ways people reacted in 1665 could be the very same ways people might have reacted today to a mysterious, deadly, and highly contagious outbreak.</p>\n\t\t",

It’s an episodic, picaresque novel that recounts Moll’s long life of misadventures. It has a journalistic, plain style, with unadorned, prosaic speech that flows naturally from story to story.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is written as a purported autobiography over the course of the narrator’s life. As a young orphan in poverty, Moll claims she wants to be a “gentlewoman” when she gets older, not fully understanding what the term means. What she desires is simply independence and a life free from servitude. In adulthood, she pursues this in two ways. She first attempts to find security by marrying a wealthy husband, and—after several failures and diminishing options—she turns to thievery. In her interactions, Moll proves streetsmart, deft, and quick on her feet. By traveling back and forth between England and the American colonies, the novel offers a lens into different societies through a variety of occupations.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Moll is an enterprising female protagonist, a true individual. Though she receives some help, she is largely on her own in risky situations. She often relies on disguise and deceiving others, but she is always honest with the reader and tells us exactly what she is thinking, including her guilt and remorse.</p>\n\t\t",

First published in 1719, it can also claim to be one of the first novels ever written in English.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Written in the form of an autobiography, it describes the life of the eponymous narrator Robinson Crusoe. A wild youth, he breaks away from his family to go to sea. After many adventures including being captured and made into a slave, he is eventually shipwrecked on a remote island off the coast of South America. Crusoe is the only survivor of the wreck. He is thus forced to find ways to survive on the island without any other assistance. His first years are miserable and hard, but he ultimately manages to domesticate goats and raise crops, making his life tolerable. While suffering from an illness, he undergoes a profound religious conversion, and begins to ascribe his survival to a beneficent Providence.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Crusoe lives alone on the island for more than twenty years until his life changes dramatically after he discovers a human footprint in the sand, indicating the undeniable presence of other human beings. These, it turns out, are the native inhabitants of the mainland, who visit the island only occasionally. To Crusoe’s horror, he discovers that these people practice cannibalism. He rescues one of their prisoners, who becomes his servant (or “man”) Friday, named for the day of the week on which he rescued him, and together, their adventures continue.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dante-alighieri\">Dante Alighieri’s</a> <i>Divine Comedy</i> is considered one of the greatest works in world literature, and it established the standardized Italian language that is used today. Writing between 1308 and 1320, Dante draws from countless subjects including Roman Catholic theology and philosophy, the struggle between the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire, Greek mythology, and geocentric cosmology to answer the age-old question: what does the afterlife look like? Dante’s vision of the answer, this three-volume epic poem, describes in great detail the systematic levels in Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The poem opens with Dante’s death—not his actual death that would come shortly after his work’s completion, but his fictional death—where the author is found wandering in a dark forest. Blocked from climbing towards the bright light by a she-wolf, a leopard, and a lion, he is forced to walk further into the darkened valley and towards the gates of Hell. Dante and his guides must then travel through the nine circles of Hell, seven terraces of Purgatory, and nine spheres of Heaven to experience divine justice for earthly sins so that he may reach the Empyrean and receive God’s love. On his journey, he will learn that one must be consciously devoted to the path of morality and righteousness, else one find oneself on a path towards sin.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s blank verse translation. Longfellow succeeds in capturing the original brilliance of Dante’s internal rhymes and hypnotic patterns while also retaining accuracy. It is said that the death of his young wife brought him closer to the melancholy spirit of Dante’s writing, which itself was shaped by his wounding exile from his beloved Florence in 1302.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>On hearing the title <i>A Voyage to Arcturus</i>, one might picture an astronaut strapping themselves into a rocket and flying into space for a swashbuckling adventure. Nothing could be further from what this book actually is.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Voyage</i> is in fact a fascinating, bizarre, bewildering, and thought-provoking sort of acid-fueled <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-bunyan/the-pilgrims-progress\"><i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i></a>: a philosophical allegory told through the frame of a psychedelic gender-bending journey to an alien planet.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After a terrifying séance, the protagonist, Maskull, is offered the chance of an adventure on a different world. He agrees, and the reader follows him on his blood-soaked path through lands representing different philosophies and ways of life as he searches for the world’s godhead, Surtur. Or is it Crystalman?</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Voyage</i> features fiction wildly ahead of its time, and is hardly classifiable as either science fiction or fantasy; one might even say that the book is better approached as a philosophical work than a straightforward narrative. It’s not a book for a reader seeking simple fiction, but rather for a reader seeking a thoughtful, imaginative, and totally unexpected exploration of philosophy and of life.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Decades ahead of its time, <i>Voyage</i> was praised by contemporaries like <abbr>C. S.</abbr> Lewis and <abbr>J. R. R.</abbr> Tolkien, and by modern authors like Clive Barker and Alan Moore. Many modern reviewers consider it a masterpiece of 20th century fiction and the work of an underappreciated genius. A century later it boasts a significant cult following, having inspired movies, plays, albums, and even operas, as well as a modern sequel by famous literary critic Harold Bloom—the only work of fiction he ever wrote.</p>\n\t\t",

He based these on a variety of sources that have since been lost. Because of this, his biographies have become an invaluable source of information on the development of ancient Greek philosophy, and on ancient Greek culture in general. Most of what we know about the lives and otherwise lost doctrines of Zeno the Stoic and Diogenes the Cynic, for example, come from what Diogenes Laërtius preserved in this book. Mourning what else we have lost, Montaigne wrote: “I am very sorry we have not a dozen Laërtii.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Steamy romance, barbed humor, wicked cattiness, tender acts of humanity, jealous feuds, terrible puns, sophistical paradoxes, deathbed deceptions, forgery, and political intrigue … while the philosophers of ancient Greece were developing their remarkable and penetrating philosophies, they were also leading strange and varied lives—at times living out their principles in practice, at other times seeming to defy all principle.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Diogenes Laërtius collected as much biographical information as he could find about these ancient sages, and tried to sift through the sometimes contradictory accounts to find the true story. He shares with us anecdotes and witty remarks and biographical details that reveal the people behind the philosophies, and frequently adds a brief poem of his own construction that comments sardonically on how each philosopher died.</p>\n\t\t",

She died intestate, but her great-niece, with whom she was living, was set to inherit the considerable estate. Suspecting something wrong, the doctor demanded an autopsy, which showed nothing unusual, but stirred up such local animosity that the he was forced to abandon his practice. Wimsey, sensing a mystery, decides to investigate—but his investigation triggers a series of deadly events.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>One of the delights of the book is the introduction of a new character in Miss Alexandra Climpson, a middle-aged spinster whom Wimsey employs as an investigative agent, and whose effusive reports of the gossip she picks up in the town are very amusing.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Unnatural Death</i> is notable for its inclusion of one clearly lesbian character—a decision unusual in detective fiction at the time—and the very sympathetic treatment by Wimsey of a black character (though offensively racist terms for him are used by others in the book).</p>\n\t\t\t<p>An adaptation of the book was made for BBC radio in 1975.</p>\n\t\t",

Adela Quested, a young British subject, is visiting India to decide whether to marry a suitor who works there as a city magistrate. During her visit, a local physician, Aziz, is accused of assaulting her. His trial brings tensions between the British rulers and their Indian subjects to a head.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is a complex exploration of colonialism, written at a time when the popular portrayal of the Indian continent was of mystery and savagery. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-m-forster\">Forster</a> humanized the Indian people for his at-home British audience, highlighting the damage that colonialism caused not just to interpersonal relationships, but to society at large. On the other hand, some modern scholars view the failure of the human relationships in the book as suggesting a fundamental “otherness” between the two cultures: a gulf across which the disparate cultures can only see each other’s shadows. In any case, the novel generated—and continues to generate—an abundant amount of critical analysis.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>A Passage to India</i> is the last novel Forster published in his lifetime, and it frequently appears in “best-of” lists of literature: The Modern Library selected it as one of its <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/modern-librarys-100-best-novels\">100 great works of the 20th century</a>, <i>Time</i> magazine included it in its “All Time 100 Novels” list, and it won the 1924 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.</p>\n\t\t",

The plot revolves around three families in Edwardian England: the Schlegels, a trio of half-German, middle-class siblings who to poor people seem rich, but to rich people seem poor; the Wilcoxes, a large, wealthy family of businessmen; and the Basts, a lower class young couple struggling to keep up appearances.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The Schlegel siblings are sharp, intelligent, and idealistic, and they pursue culture and art with an enthusiasm reminiscent of the Bloomsbury group. They befriend the Wilcoxes while on a trip abroad, and the lonely Wilcox matriarch and Margaret Schlegel, the strong-willed elder sister, strike up a friendship. As their families begin butting heads in London, Helen, the younger Schlegel sister, runs in to Leonard Bast while at the opera. Bast is proud and ambitious, but clearly impoverished and lacking gentility. Helen, a rash and fiery idealist, takes him up as a pet project, oblivious to the deep cultural gulf between Bast and themselves as she tries her best to educate him in matters of art and literature and lift him out of his class.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The interplay between the three families becomes a complex reflection on social codes and class difference in England: how class can lock lives in place, and how even the well-to-do are not immune from becoming ossified in their station thanks to the seemingly-unbreakable social conventions of the age. Capitalism, a still-new philosophy of life, is juxtaposed against humanism and the arts as the families try to do what they each think is the right thing. Forster weaves these threads expertly against the backdrop of London city life and the cozy family cottage of Howards End, the ultimate centerpiece in these three families’ lives.</p>\n\t\t",

As in her other children’s books, it begins in the everyday world but quickly brings in the fantastical and magical. A large part of the delight of Nesbit’s books is that her children behave in quite ordinary ways, getting into scrapes, getting dirty and their clothes torn, making decisions which seem right to them at the time but which are generally wrong-headed. It’s the contrast between the ordinariness of the children and the magical adventures they become involved in which makes the books so charming.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Enchanted Castle</i> was originally serialized in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> alongside stories by <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rudyard-kipling\">Rudyard Kipling</a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle\">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>. The first book edition was published in 1907.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the story, Kathleen and her brothers Gerald and Jimmy find a way into a remarkable garden designed to create a Palladian landscape, full of statues and pseudo-Classical temples and buildings. It is not long before they come across a sleeping Princess. They wake her, and she introduces them to an item of real magical value, a ring which makes its wearer invisible. But once on, the ring won’t come off! “Those of my readers who have gone about much with an invisible companion will not need to be told how awkward the whole business is,” comments the author, which is indicative of the simple and direct language she uses, and the humor of the books. Even the invisibility ring, however, is not quite as simple as it seems; and many interesting and amusing adventures follow.</p>\n\t\t",

Like her other, perhaps better known tales, such as <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit/five-children-and-it\">Five Children and It</a></i>, the story takes quite ordinary children of the time and plunges them into fantastical adventures.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In this book, two children, with the interesting Saxon names of Edred and Elfrida, aged 10 and 12 respectively, discover that due to the death of a distant relative, young Edred is now Lord of Arden. The estate consists of not much more than a little money, a crumbling castle, and an attached house. An old retainer tells them of a legend regarding the Lord of Arden and a buried treasure. Naturally they are eager to locate the treasure, which may help them restore the castle. They discover a way to summon up the mascot of the House, a white mole or “mouldiwarp,” who enables them to travel back through time in search of the treasure.</p>\n\t\t",

Since its first book publication in 1906, it has been made into movies, radio plays and television series several times, dramatised in the theatre, performed in actual railway stations, and even turned into a musical.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>It tells the story of three children: Roberta, Peter and Phyllis, who with their mother are forced to leave their comfortable suburban home and go to live in a small cottage in the country, after their father is taken away from them for what at first seem inexplicable reasons. They live there very quietly, not going to school, whilst their mother writes stories and poems to earn a small income. The children’s lives, however, are greatly enlivened by their proximity to a nearby railway line and station, in which they take great interest. They befriend the railway staff and have several adventures in which they demonstrate considerable initiative and courage.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>One unusual topic touched on by the book is the then-current Russia-Japan war, which divided opinion in England. Nesbit was clearly opposed to the actions of the Tsarist government of Russia, and she introduces into the story a <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy\">Tolstoy</a>-like Russian writer who has escaped from a prison camp in Siberia, to which he was condemned for publishing a book espousing his liberal views.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>In this conclusion to the <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/psammead-trilogy\">Psammead Trilogy</a>, Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane are reunited with the cantankerous Sand-fairy. While the old creature can’t grant them wishes anymore, it points them towards an old Egyptian amulet that can grant their hearts’ desire—in this case the return of their parents and baby brother. While their amulet is only half of a whole, it still acts as a time portal which they use to visit locales like Ancient Egypt, Babylon, Atlantis, and even a utopian future in search of the missing other half.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Perhaps one of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-nesbit\">E. Nesbit’s</a> most personal works, <i>The Story of the Amulet</i> benefited from her interest in the ancient world, particularly Egypt. With the help of A. E. Wallis Budge, to whom the book is dedicated—then Head of the Assyrian Departments of the British Museum and translator of the Egyptian <i>Book of the Dead</i>—she conducted extensive research on the topic and is thus able to bring an exquisite attention to detail. For example, the titular amulet is shaped after the <i>tyet</i>, an Egyptian symbol also known as the “knot of Isis.” Likewise, the inscription at the back of the amulet is written in authentic Egyptian hieroglyphs.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>A staunch supporter of democratic socialism and a founding member of the Fabian Society, E. Nesbit cultivated friendships with other like-minded writers, such as <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-bernard-shaw\">George Bernard Shaw</a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells\">H. G. Wells</a>, whose influence on this book is easy to notice. She practiced what she preached, so much so that despite her literary successes, her acts of charity brought her close to bankruptcy.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>These political beliefs are prominently displayed in the book. The children encounter memorable characters during their adventures, chief among them the Queen of Babylon, who causes quite a stir when she later pays them a call in their contemporary London. When the visiting Queen witnesses the squalid living conditions of the London working class, she’s amazed at how poorly they’re treated compared to the slaves of her own Babylon. Likewise, the utopian future—which features a wink to her friend H. G. Wells, the “great reformer”—is a striking contrast in terms of the happiness, care, and education of the general populace.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book’s legacy can be found in the works of other writers. Most notably, C. S. Lewis incorporated several elements in his <i>Chronicles of Narnia</i>: the Calormene civilization of <i>The Horse and His Boy</i> draws heavily from <i>The Amulet</i>’s Babylon, and the episode in <i>The Magician’s Nephew</i> where Jadis, the White Witch, causes chaos during her short stay in London is also a direct homage to the aforementioned visit from the Queen. The format of these stories, where a group of people take their audience on adventures through time and space to learn about distant cultures, is an uncanny precursor to the popular British TV series <i>Doctor Who</i>.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Worm Ouroboros</i> is considered to be one of the foundational texts of the high fantasy genre, influencing later authors like J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Ursula K. Leguin, and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-branch-cabell\">James Branch Cabell</a>. It is most frequently compared to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> in its epic scope set against a medieval, magic-laced backdrop—a world called “Middle Earth” by <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/e-r-eddison\">Eddison</a>, thirty-two years before Tolkien’s—and in its almost mythical portrayal of larger-than-life heroes and villains.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The plot begins simply enough: The Lords of Demonland, a group of heroic warriors enjoying a strained peace, are called upon by an emissary of the warlock king of Witchland, Gorice XI. The emissary demands that Demonland submit to the King of Witchland—but the proud Demons refuse, setting off an epic war that spans their entire world. The heroic struggles of the Demons and their allies against the Witches reflect the circular nature of human history: the snake eating its own tail of the title.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is written in a purposefully archaic, almost Jacobean style. The rich, surprising vocabulary and unusual spelling are testaments to Eddison’s expertise at reading and translating medieval-era texts. To this day, it remains perhaps unique in fantasy literature in the accuracy and precision of its highly affected prose style, perhaps matched only by the out-of-time strangeness of the prose in <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-hope-hodgson\">Hodgson’s</a> <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-hope-hodgson/the-night-land\">The Night Land</a></i>. But where critics often find <i>The Night Land</i>’s prose obtuse and difficult, they have nothing but praise for Eddison’s beautiful, quotable style.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Eddison had already imagined the story and its heroes as a child, and drawings he made as a youth of events in the book are preserved in the Bodleian library. While the novel is without a doubt the work of a mature and skilled writer, and while some of the events and characters are portrayed differently in the novel than they were in his youthful sketches, the names of many of the characters and places remain unchanged. Some of his contemporaries, like Tolkien, wondered about the strange naming style; others criticized it as taking away from the more serious subject matter.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Worm Ouroboros</i> remains one of the most influential works in the high fantasy genre to this day, and traces of the foundation it laid can be still be found in genre books a century after its publication.</p>\n\t\t",

His incisive wit and poetic imagery allow the reader to peer into the foibles of society and the follies of human psychology.

Part proto-science-fiction and part Romantic fantasy, <i>Master Flea</i> follows the fate of a mysterious, captivating princess at the intersection of numerous suitors, human and insect.

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe\">Edgar Allan Poe</a> is one of the primary figures of American nineteenth-century literature. His writing was heavily influenced by Romanticism ideals of emotion and feeling, and although mostly known for his Gothic-tinged horror, his tales jump between many different genres, including science-fiction, satire, humor, mystery, and even early detective fiction.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Poe mostly wrote short stories and poems, published in magazines and periodicals like the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i> and <i>Graham’s Magazine</i>, although he also turned his hand to essays and novels (including <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe/the-narrative-of-arthur-gordon-pym-of-nantucket\"><i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</i></a>). He was one of the first American writers to pursue writing as a career, but was better received in France than in his native country. He struggled to make ends meet and resorted to work as a literary critic. His reputation suffered a further blow after his unfortunately early death in 1849 at the age of 40, when a rival not only wrote an extremely unflattering obituary, but bought the rights to his work and published a compilation with a hit piece for an introduction. This undeserved reputation took many decades to fade, but didn’t hinder praise from other notable authors including <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle\">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft\"><abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Collected here are all of Poe’s short fiction stories, in order of their original magazine publication. Notable stories include “The Gold-Bug,” “The Black Cat,” “The Fall of the House of Usher,” “The Masque of the Red Death,” “The Pit and the Pendulum,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” and many more.</p>\n\t\t",

In true Barsoomian fashion, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-rice-burroughs\">Burroughs</a> regales us with an action-packed adventure: planet-shaking storms, daring swordfights, horrific dungeons, complex alien cultures, and wild escapes. While the story may be considered a standard pulp adventure, it also introduces a bit of philosophy by exploring the connection between the mind and the body.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Of special note is Jetan, or Martian chess, which holds a central place in the storyline. Burroughs includes an appendix so that interested readers may play the game themselves.</p>\n\t\t",

After ten long years, John Carter is again transported to Mars to try and determine the fate of his wife Dejah Thoris, but finds himself in the forbidden Valley Dor, from which no man may return.

Her mistress Mademoiselle de Varandeuil treats her fairly, and in Jupillon, son of a local dairy-shop owner, she finds a secret lover. But her generous nature and self-sacrificial spirit make her vulnerable to his abuse and depravity. Her boundless love and loyalty will ultimately plunge her into debt, alcoholism, nymphomania, and depression—and a never-ending struggle to hide the dark side of her life from her mistress.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In this, their fourth novel, the brothers <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edmond-de-goncourt\">Edmond</a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jules-de-goncourt\">Jules de Goncourt</a>, took inspiration from events close to home: the passing of their maidservant Rose revealed her sordid hidden life, much like Germinie’s. They called the novel that arose from their shock and surprise at Rose’s secrets their <em>clinic of love</em>—and it was met with high praise and utter disgust alike. A young <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emile-zola\">Émile Zola</a> adored the novel, and Vincent van Gogh called it “life as it is,” making the book one of the subjects of a still life. Other contemporary writers were less enthusiastic, calling it “putrid” and “chiseled mire.” This could hardly have been a surprise to the Goncourt brothers, for they already warned in the preface: “this book furnishes entertainment of a melancholy, violent sort calculated to disarrange the habits and injure the health of the public.”</p>\n\t\t",

The epic poem is incomplete, as only six of the intended twelve books were published before his death. Despite that, it stands as one of the longest poems in the English language.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>During its composition, Spenser invented a new type of verse form: the Spenserian stanza. The form consists of eight lines in iambic pentameter followed by a line in iambic hexameter, with the rhyme scheme <i>ababbcbcc</i>. He purposely included archaic language and spelling to make the work feel comparable to the Arthurian myths written during the Middle Ages.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Spenser used Aristotle’s list of virtues as the foundation for his work. Each of the six books follows a different knight who symbolize a unique virtue: the Knight of the Redcross for Holiness, Guyon for Temperance, Britomartis for Chastity, Cambell and Telamond for Friendship, Artegall for Justice, and Calidore for Courtesy. Fragments of an unfinished seventh book—the “Cantos of Mutability”—would have centered on the virtue of Constancy. In a letter to Sir Walter Raleigh, Spenser reveals that King Arthur represents the virtue of Magnificence, “the perfection of all the rest.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The first book opens with the Redcross Knight on a quest ordered by Queen Gloriana to defeat a horrible dragon. Traveling with him is Lady Una and her dwarf servant, who are leading the knight to the land where the dragon dwells. A terrible storm forces the travelers to shelter in the nearest cave—and a monster’s den.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> tells the story of the Roman Empire from the time of Trajan in the third century to the fall of Constantinople in the sixteenth. Along the way <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edward-gibbon\">Gibbon</a> describes not only the internal issues that arise within the empire, but also the various outside forces that contribute to its fall: the Goths, Huns, Persians, Muslims, and many others. He also has two highly controversial (at the time, and still today for some) chapters on his view of the role of Christianity in the empire’s unraveling, which caused a firestorm when the first volume of the history was published.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As a history, it is perhaps without peer. Gibbon committed to studying, and quoting, first-hand sources whenever possible, and had an unerring eye for the difference between facts, opinions, and nonsense. He quoted from 1,850 unique sources written in eleven languages, and was scrupulous about referencing those sources: his text of over a million words contains almost 8,000 endnotes of another 400,000 words. Although history might be static, the study of it is not, resulting in his later nineteenth century editors adding another twenty percent to those notes with updates, corrections, and additional information that had come to light since the original publication.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But if <i>Decline and Fall</i> excels at history, it is even better as literature, for Gibbon was not only an outstanding historian, he was also a remarkable writer. His narrative reads more like a novel than a dry history text, and his dry wit is apparent throughout, especially in his notes.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In an effort to make it easier for the reader to refer to Gibbon’s sources if desired, this edition expands the often cryptic abbreviations used in the source references, both for the publication titles and the author’s names.</p>\n\t\t",

During this period he was employed to paint the birds from the private menagerie owned by Edward Stanley, the 13th Earl of Derby and one of Lear’s closest friends. In 1837, Lear’s health started to decline. His deteriorating eyesight and failing lungs forced him to abandon the detailed painting required for depicting birds, and, with the help of the earl, he moved to Rome where he established himself as a poet of literary nonsense.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While Lear was visiting the Earl of Derby, he wrote poems and drew silly sketches to entertain the earl’s children. In 1846, he collected together his pile of limericks and illustrations and published his first poetical book, titled <i>A Book of Nonsense</i> and dedicated to the Earl of Derby and his children. He decided to publish under the pseudonym Derry down Derry, but after he started making plans for more books, he republished under his real name.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>His next book, <i>Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany, and Alphabets</i> wasn’t published until 24 years later, in 1870. Lear then released <i>More Nonsense</i>, which contains more limericks, in 1872, and <i>Laughable Lyrics</i> in 1877. This final book in the series contains many of Lear’s most famous fantastical creatures, such as the Quangle Wangle. The influence of Lear’s poetry in the twentieth-century can be seen in styles like the surrealism movement and the theater of the absurd.</p>\n\t\t",

The first part takes place in Boston when she is age 13, having just been rehabilitated from severe injuries sustained in an automobile accident. As she leaves the hospital, she is sent to stay with a nearby dowager, who has long withdrawn into grief, pining for her lost nephew. Pollyanna is to be her “cure.” After leaving Boston, Pollyanna leaves the country with her Aunt Polly and doesn’t return to Vermont until she is 20 years old.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While in Boston, Pollyanna observes her host’s isolation and depression, which sits in stark contrast with the opulence of her home and her material wealth. Meanwhile, naive, relentlessly positive, literal-minded Pollyanna, often oblivious to the structure of society around her, slowly comes to understand the dire, grinding poverty, isolation, and alienation that turn-of-the-century Boston was also home to. Human connection is a central theme of the book and Pollyanna begins to engage with broader cultural and moral questions of her society before departing the country.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the second half of the book, Pollyanna acts as host to the friends she made in Boston. As such, she reconnects with them and puts them in touch with her friends and family in Vermont. As a part of growing up, Pollyanna must now address questions of how these relationships might change as her age and social status change. She must reconcile the sense of obligation she feels with her desires, and with the wants and needs of those around her. Old relationships are expanded, and new relationships are formed (or revealed) with each, in the end, more connected to all.</p>\n\t\t",

Spread out over fifty cantos, we hear how existence was created from the egg of a duck, how the forests were created from the chips of a world-tree felled by an ancient wizard, how the mighty Sampo—a multicolored mill of plenty—was created and later stolen, how the nine dread diseases came to be, and many more such stories.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The tales contained here are formed from Finland’s oral history. The author, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/elias-lonnrot\">Elias Lönnrot</a>, was a Finnish doctor who was fascinated with his country’s stories, so between the 1820s and 1850s he embarked on a series of expeditions to the countryside of Finland and the surrounding area to collect and transcribe the folk stories told by local people. These tales were gradually collected into several volumes, the final of which is this “new” <i>Kalevala</i>. Lönnrot collected many different variants of each story, then edited each down into a cohesive whole when composing the new verse. The distinctive Kalevala-meter that was a common feature of all the original oral stories was kept during the process, and Crawford used the same with this English translation.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Lönnrot’s work proved extremely influential in Finland, and the national pride it imbued has been cited as a factor in the later Finnish independence movement. The <i>Kalevala</i> was also a source of inspiration for later authors of the twentieth century. Tolkien reused some of the themes and characters for the basis of his fictional universe (in particular <i>The Silmarillion</i>), the Kalevala-meter was used in Longfellow’s <i>The Song of Hiawatha</i>, and even Donald Duck has quested—as the Kalevala heroes did—for the legendary Sampo.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This edition was translated by John Martin Crawford in the late nineteenth century, and includes his introduction discussing some of the themes, characters, and settings.</p>\n\t\t",

In this first book, Lecoq plays a relatively small part, the bulk of the mystery solving being done by Lecoq’s mentor Tabaret, an amateur detective.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Gaboriau thus introduces both a police detective and an amateur detective at the same time. Many of the attributes now taken for granted in the mystery arena originated with Gaboriau and Lecoq—hyper attention to detail, mastery of disguises, amateur “agents” who assist the detective, and the above-mentioned amateur detectives that assist and sometimes out-perform the police versions.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Gaboriau’s Lecoq novels were wildly successful until another amateur detective named <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes\">Holmes</a> made his appearance. Holmes even comments on Lecoq in <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/a-study-in-scarlet\"><i>A Study in Scarlet</i></a>, dismissing him as a “miserable bungler” in response to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Watson’s question. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle\">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> was obviously influenced by Gaboriau and Lecoq, as many of Holmes’ traits can be seen first in Lecoq.</p>\n\t\t",

One would be forgiven for thinking the detective must be a certain famous Englishman and his doctor companion.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But this detective is French rather than English, a professional working for the police rather than an amateur, and indulges in candy lozenges rather than cocaine.

The book follows Étienne Lantier, a young man whose career as a railway worker is abruptly cut short after he attacks a superior. He arrives in Montsou, a coal mining town in the north of France, to begin a new life in a different industry. And the only industry around is mining coal.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Étienne quickly befriends the locals as he embraces his new life in the mines, but the abject poverty of the miners shocks him, and he soon begins reading about socialism. When the owners of the mine conspire to lower the miners’ wages, Étienne seizes the opportunity and convinces the town to strike.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Zola’s depiction of the mining town is shockingly bleak in its detail. He spent months researching the conditions of real-life miners, even going so far as pose as a government official so that he could descend into a mine personally. His encounter with a mining horse—brought underground as a foal to haul coal, never to see the light of day again—affected him so much that he wrote the animal into the plot. Montsou itself is a fully-realized town, with families and characters leading interconnected and nuanced lives across generations: lives so destitute, grueling, and filthy that Zola had to repeatedly defend his work against claims of hyperbole.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Ultimately, the novel was a rallying cry for the workers of the world in an era when communist and socialist ideas were beginning to spread amongst the impoverished working class. The shabby but good-hearted inhabitants of Montsou, so blatantly oppressed by the bourgeois mine owners, are a blank slate for workers of any industry to identify with, and identify they did: <i>Germinal</i> inspired socialist causes for decades after its publication, with crowds chanting “Germinal!” at Zola’s funeral.</p>\n\t\t",

In it we see Claude Lantier, a painter with obvious talent, struggle to leave a revolutionary mark on the art world of 19th-century Paris. The novel deftly explores the themes of genius, poverty, purity in art, art as a bureaucratic institution, obsession, and madness.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book is notable not just for its accurate portrayal of the art world of the time, but also for the interesting personal details Zola incorporated into the book. Lantier is a pastiche of several famous painters Zola personally knew, including Paul Cézanne, Claude Monet, and Édouard Manet; Lantier’s masterpiece is based on Manet’s revolutionary painting <i>Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe</i>; and the novel’s accuracy is even blamed on ending the long friendship between Zola and Cézanne. Zola himself includes a self-portrait, as the character Pierre Sandoz.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Vizetelly’s translation is fresh and readable, and Zola’s rendition of Paris and the surrounding countryside is vibrant and engrossing.

The book’s two locations, the genteel Thrushcross Grange and the wild Wuthering Heights, serve as matching backgrounds to the characters of their occupants, as they struggle to gain the upper hand in marriage and power. All the while, the ghosts of the past seem to drive revenge more than inspire forgiveness.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> was <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emily-bronte\">Emily Brontë’s</a> sole published novel before her early death at the age of 30. Published under the pen name of Ellis Bell, a shared surname with the pen names of her sisters, many assumed that such a book could only have been written by a man. Reviewers of the time praised its emotional power but were also shocked at the actions of its characters, and most agreed that it was impossible to put down. After the novel’s original publication in 1847 it was revised into a single volume in 1850, and over time has become a classic of English literature. The story has been reworked into plays, operas, films, TV dramatisations and a ballet, and has inspired many further works of art, music and literature.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>In 1919, at the height of the anti-leftist Palmer Raids conducted by the Wilson administration, the anarchist activist and writer <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emma-goldman\">Emma Goldman</a> was deported to the nascent Soviet Union. Despite initial plans to fight the deportation order in court, Goldman eventually acquiesced in order to take part in the new revolutionary Russia herself. While initially supportive of the Bolsheviks, with some reservations, Goldman’s firsthand experiences with Bolshevik oppression and corruption prompted her titular disillusionment and eventual emigration to Germany.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In <i>My Disillusionment in Russia</i>, Goldman records her travels throughout Russia as part of a revolutionary museum commission, and her interactions with a variety of political and literary figures like Vladimir Lenin, Maxim Gorky, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-reed\">John Reed</a>, and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/peter-kropotkin\">Peter Kropotkin</a>. Goldman concludes her account with a critique of the Bolshevik ideology in which she asserts that revolutionary change in institutions cannot take place without corresponding changes in values.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>My Disillusionment in Russia</i> had a troubled publication history, since the first American printing in 1923 omitted the last twelve chapters of what was supposed to be a thirty-three chapter book. (Somehow, the last chapters failed to reach the publisher, who did not suspect the book to be incomplete.) The situation was remedied with the publication of the remaining chapters in 1924 as part of a volume titled <i>My Further Disillusionment in Russia</i>. This Standard Ebooks edition compiles both volumes into a single volume, following the intent of the original manuscript.</p>\n\t\t",

There is no point in getting upset about things that are outside of your control; that only leads to distress. Instead, let such things be however they are, and focus your effort on the things that are in your control: your own attitudes and priorities. This way, you can never be thrown off balance, and tranquility is yours for the taking.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The lessons in the <i>Discourses of Epictetus</i>, along with his <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/epictetus/short-works/george-long\">Enchiridion</a></i>, have continued to attract new adherents to Stoic philosophy down to the present day.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-hemingway\">Ernest Hemingway</a> is perhaps the most influential American writer of the twentieth century. Though known mostly for his longer works, he began his writing career with the publication of short stories which helped develop his often-imitated concise, simple, and straightforward style, which stood in stark contrast to the more elaborate prose of many of his contemporaries.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In 1947, during a University of Mississippi creative writing class, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-faulkner\">William Faulkner</a> remarked that Hemingway “has never been known to use a word that might cause the reader to check with a dictionary to see if it is properly used.” Hemingway famously responded: “Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don’t know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Besides his writing style, Hemingway’s most well-known contribution to the literary landscape was the iceberg theory of writing, developed while composing the short story “Out of Season.” Hemingway later said of the story: “I had omitted the real end of it which was that the old man hanged himself. This was omitted on my new theory that you could omit anything if you knew that you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This collection comprises all of the public domain stories published in Hemingway’s short story collections, some miscellaneous stories published in various magazines, and his novellas. With the exception of stories within collections with a thematic link, such as <i>In Our Time</i>, they are arranged in publication order.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Sun Also Rises</i> was <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-hemingway\">Ernest Hemingway’s</a> first published novel, and the novel that introduced the term “Lost Generation” to describe the generation that came to adulthood during World War I.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel follows Jake Barnes, an American expat living in the Parisian café society of the roaring 20s. A wound sustained during the war has left him unable to have sex, and that drives a wedge between him and the woman he loves: Brett Ashley, a twice-divorcée who has embraced the sexual freedom and independence of the age. As they drift through their lives in postwar Paris, they find themselves on a trip with some friends to Spain to witness the Festival of San Fermin, a week-long bacchanal whose highlight is bullfighting.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Hemingway explores the aimless, heavy drinking, and dramatic lives of Jake, Brett, and their friends as a means to reflect the Lost Generation as a whole. Jake is a character of troubled masculinity: his war wound has fundamentally changed him as a man, and his behavior is often tentative, unsure, and placating. On the other hand, Brett is an enigmatic New Woman: free to drink and carouse with the men, she is seductive, but aching for the reassurance and love of a real relationship, and not just sex. The satellites of friends that orbit around them are equally troubled, drinking to excess and fighting with themselves and with others.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>These complex characters are now mere spectators for the bullfight, a microcosm of war and death whose masters, the matadors, are the powerful and elegant emblems of masculinity that the Lost Generation finds it impossible to compete against.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though initially met with mixed reviews, modern critics consider it to be Hemingway’s best novel. The characters and events are largely based on real-life people in Hemingway’s social circle and his time spent in Paris and Spain. Thus, the book sold very well in its first print run, as the expatriate community was eager to read about the coded scandals of their peers. Today it is recognized as a foundational work of the modernist style, and an American classic.</p>\n\t\t",

The framing device, where Childers pretends to be an editor presenting a factual account, only adds to the believability of the story.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel begins with Carruthers, an official in the Foreign Office, accepting an invitation from his friend Davies for what he assumes is a pleasure trip on a sailboat in the Baltic sea. As the two embark on their journey, it quickly becomes apparent that not everything is at it seems on the German coast.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Riddle</i> helped energize the spy novel genre, providing a template for countless authors to come, including Ian Fleming and John le Carré, and has been adapted numerous times for film, television and radio.</p>\n\t\t",

It was first produced in 1922 by the Provincetown Players in Massachusetts, embracing expressionism in its set design and staging, before moving on to Broadway, where it faced resistance from local and federal governments due to its radical views.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play examines the existential crisis of the protagonist, a brutish stoker named Yank, who begins the play secure in his role as the leader of firemen on an Atlantic ocean liner. But when confronted by the disdain of an upper-class passenger who calls him a “filthy beast,” he seeks to rebel against his place. Then, as all his plans for revenge fail, he slowly finds himself descending to the literal level that society has relegated him to.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>O’Neill uses Yank’s search for belonging to explore the destructive forces of industrialization and social class. Early on, <i>The Hairy Ape</i>’s commentary on the dehumanization of workers caused it to be taken up by many labor groups and unions to further their own causes. The play also touches on themes of masculinity and socialism, and the repeated references to the “blackface” of the ship’s stokers and Yank’s degeneration into an animal have added a racial element to recent analyses.</p>\n\t\t",

But when he meets Gloria, a vibrant young flapper, the two feel an irresistible attraction and quickly get married despite their clashing personalities.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The two embark on a lifestyle of Jazz Age living: hard partying, profligate spending, and generally living the high life. But Anthony’s prohibitionist grandfather soon finds out and disowns Anthony, sending their lifestyle crashing down from its former heights to intolerable indignity.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Like <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald\">Fitzgerald’s</a> previous novel, <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald/this-side-of-paradise\">This Side of Paradise</a></i>, and his next novel, <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald/the-great-gatsby\">The Great Gatsby</a></i>, <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> documents the life of the idle rich in America’s Jazz Age. Both Anthony and Gloria’s characters explore the problem of what one is left to do when one has no other purpose in life. Because Anthony’s expecting a large inheritance, his ambition is muzzled and he feels no need to embark on a career or participate in the betterment of society. Gloria’s main purpose in life was to find a husband; once she’s done that, what’s left except spending money and partying?</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The relationship between Anthony and Gloria is the explosive propellant that drives the plot. The two are clearly a poor match for each other. While Anthony is an aimless aesthete who expects to inherit wealth and power, Gloria is a self-absorbed socialite mostly banking on her undisputed beauty. Their mutual selfishness leads to constant conflict, and eventually, to mutual dislike. But despite that, the two remain together, locked in to their self-absorption, lack of ambition, and obsession with the past, as Anthony descends into alcoholism and Gloria into desperate middle age.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Anthony and Gloria are fairly transparent fictionalizations of Fitzgerald himself and his wife Zelda. Their relationship was famously tumultuous, and parallels Anthony and Gloria’s highs and lows. Fitzgerald himself was born to upper-middle-class wealth and led a aimless youth before turning to the army and to writing; in his later years, he considered himself nothing more than a middling success and turned to writing for Hollywood before totally embracing the alcoholism he had courted since his college days, and that would finally kill him. Zelda, for her part, was a socialite and the canonical “flapper.” Beautiful and bubbly, she enabled the legendarily hard-partying lifestyle that fueled their bitter fights. Her mercurial disposition later led her to being committed to an asylum for schizophrenia. Even the cover illustration of the book’s first edition features a couple meant to resemble Fitzgerald and Zelda.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Today, <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> is not just a glittering record of Jazz Age excess, it’s a nuanced character study of how expectation can ruin ambition, and how relationships aren’t always easy to endure—or to dissolve.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Great Gatsby</i> is a novel that needs no introduction for a certain generation of American readers. Long taught as required reading in American schools, critics have consistently held it up alongside <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/herman-melville/moby-dick\">Moby Dick</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain/the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn\">Huck Finn</a></i>, and <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> as perhaps the quintessential Great American Novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Nick Carraway is a young Midwestern man freshly arrived in New York to make his fortune. He rents a shabby apartment in Long Island next door to a sumptuous mansion: the home of the mysterious and wealthy Jay Gatsby. Carraway spends time catching up with his distant cousin Daisy and her industry-baron husband Tom before being invited to one of Gatsby’s wildly lavish weekend parties. There he meets Jordan, a flapper and a golf star, and an intricate web of romances and betrayals begins to unfold.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is a colorful study of America’s Jazz Age—a term said to be coined by <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/f-scott-fitzgerald\">Fitzgerald</a> himself—complete with wealthy socialites living in hedonistic abandon, libertine flappers, jazz bands, roaring roadsters, and greasy speakeasies populated with shady grifters. Contrasted against the glamorous lives of wealthy socialites is the entrenched lower class, who live in gray, dingy squalor among smoldering ash-heaps. Fitzgerald uses the setting to examine the American Dream: the idea that anyone in America can achieve success through hard work and dedication. Gatsby has spent his life reaching for his dream. Some say he’s already achieved it. But has he? Is the dream even real for the hard-working poor that Gatsby and Tom race past in their glittering cars on the way to the decadent city?</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Fitzgerald wrote much of his real life into the novel. Like Carraway, he was a Midwesterner educated at an Ivy-league school who went to live on Long Island. Despite his meager finances he hobnobbed with socialites, and spent his career struggling for money to maintain the grand style his romantic interests were accustomed to.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The cover art, titled <i>Celestial Eyes</i>, was commissioned from Francis Cugat, who completed it before the novel was finished. The huge eyes gazing down on the blazing city so moved Fitzgerald that he wrote them into the story.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Fitzgerald saw the novel as a purely artistic work, free of the pulp pandering required by his shorter commissions—but despite that, contemporary reviews were mixed, and it sold poorly. Fitzgerald thought it a failure, and died believing the novel to be fatally obscure. Only during World War II did it come back to the public consciousness, buoyed by the support of a ring of writers and critics and printed as an Armed Service Edition to be sent to soldiers on the front. Now it is an American classic.</p>\n\t\t",

It begins with a sensational murder, as the body of a dead man is discovered in a hansom cab by the driver. Set in Melbourne, Australia, it presents an engaging story of crime and detection, with several unexpected twists and turns. It also gives a clear and interesting portrait of the colonial city at the peak of its 19th Century prosperity following a gold rush, a time when it was known as “Marvellous Melbourne.” The novel contrasts the comfortable lives of the rich and well-connected of the colony with the misery of those living in the noisome slums in the back-streets of the city.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel, originally published in serial form in a local newspaper, achieved some initial local success when it was first released in book form, but the author then sold the rights to a British company.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After warm initial reviews in England <i>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</i> became not merely a best-seller but what today we would call a “blockbuster” in the United Kingdom, its English-speaking colonies and the United States. It was the best-selling mystery novel of the Victorian era, and apparently was part of the inspiration for Conan Doyle to begin writing his Sherlock Holmes stories.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Fergus Hume eventually left Australia and returned to England.

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>When <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fitz-hugh-ludlow\">Fitz Hugh Ludlow</a> was in college, he found a jar of cannabis extract at his pharmacy, deduced that this was the fabled “hashish” described in <i>The Arabian Nights</i> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexandre-dumas/the-count-of-monte-cristo/chapman-and-hall\"><i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i></a>, and gave in to his curiosity by swallowing a spoonful. His life would never be the same.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Hashish Eater</i> attempts to describe the bizarre distortions of perspective and imagination that Ludlow experienced on extraordinarily large doses of cannabis. Because cannabis was mostly unknown in the English-speaking world at that time, he didn’t have the vocabulary to describe his “trips,” and he couldn’t expect his readers to have had similar experiences to compare. Because of this, he tests the limits of metaphor and creative description; and because of <em>that</em>, his work remains an important document to both understanding and poetically revealing the phenomenology of cannabis intoxication.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>A Man Could Stand Up—</i> opens on Armistice Day, with Valentine Wannop learning that her love, Christopher Tietjens, has returned to London from the front. As she prepares to meet him, the narrative suddenly shifts time and place to earlier in the year, with Tietjens commanding a group of soldiers in a trench somewhere in the war zone. Tietjens leads his company bravely as they shelter from the constant German strafes, before the narrative again jumps to conclude with an actual Armistice Day celebration.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In this simple narrative <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ford-madox-ford\">Ford</a> creates dense, complex character studies of Valentine and Tietjens. Tietjens, often called “the last Tory” for his staunch and unwavering approach to honor, duty, and fidelity, has changed greatly from the man he was in the <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/parades-end\">previous installments in the series</a>. Ford explores the psychological horror that the Great War inflicted on its combatants through the lens of Valentine’s gentle curiosity about Tietjen’s time on the front: men returned from battle injured not just in body, but in soul, too. The constant, unrelenting shelling, the endless strafes, the clouds of poison gas, the instant death of friends and comrades for no reason at all, the muddy and grim entrenchments where men lived and died—all of these permanently changed soldiers in ways that previous wars didn’t. Now the “last Tory” wants nothing more than to retreat from society and live a quiet life with the woman he loves—who is not his wife.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As we follow Valentine and Tietjens through the last day of the war, we see how the Great War was not just the destruction of men, but of an entire era.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>No More Parades</i> is the second in <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ford-madox-ford\">Ford Madox Ford’s</a> <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/parades-end\">Parade’s End</a> series. The book, released just a few years after the close of the war, is based on Ford’s combat experiences as an enlisted man in World War I, and continues the story first begun in <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ford-madox-ford/some-do-not\">Some Do Not …</a></i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Christopher Tietjens, after recovering from the shell shock he suffered in <i>Some Do Not …</i>, has returned to the edge of the war as a commanding officer in charge of preparing draft troops for deployment to the front. As the “last true Tory,” Tietjens demonstrates talent bordering on genius as he struggles against the laziness, incompetence, and confusion of the army around him—but his troubles only begin when his self-centered and scandalous wife Sylvia appears at his base in Rouen for a surprise visit.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Unlike <i>Some Do Not …</i>, which was told in a highly modernist series of flash-backs and flash-forwards, <i>Parade’s End</i> is a much more straightforward narrative. Despite this, the characters continue to be realized in an incredibly complex and nuanced way. Tietjens, almost a caricature of the stiff, honorable English gentleman, stoically absorbs the problems and suffering of those around him. Ford simultaneously paints him as an almost Christlike character and an immature, idealistic schoolboy, eager to keep up appearances despite the ruination it causes the people around him. Sylvia, his wife, has had her affairs and scandals, and is clearly a selfish and trying personality; but her powerful charm, and her frustration with both her almost comically stiff-lipped husband and the war’s interruption of civilization, lends her a not-unsympathetic air. The supporting cast of conscripts and officers is equally well-realized, with each one protraying a separate aspect of war’s effect on regular, scared people simply doing their best.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel was extremely well-reviewed in its time, and it and the series it’s a part of remain one of the most important novels written about World War I.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>Some Do Not …</i> opens at the cusp of World War I. Christopher Tietjens, a government statistician, and his friend Vincent Macmaster, an aspiring literary critic, are visiting the English countryside. Tietjens, preoccupied with his disastrous marriage, meets Valentine Wannop, a suffragette, during a round of golf. As their love story develops, the novel explores the horrors of the war without the narrative ever entering the battlefield.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The characters are complex and nuanced. Tietjens is an old-fashioned man even by the standards of his day; he’s concerned with honor and doing the right thing, but he lives in a society that only pays those values lip service. Yet he himself isn’t free of a thread of hypocrisy: he won’t leave his deeply unhappy marriage because that would be the wrong way to act, but the reader is left wondering if he tolerates his situation simply because he married up in class. He wants to do to the noble and right thing, but does that mean going to war?</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The men and women around him each have their individual motivations, and they are often conniving and unlikable in their aspirations even as the propaganda of England at war paints the country as a moral and heroic one. The delicate interplay of each character’s subtleties paints a rich portrait of 1920s English society, as the romantic ideals of right and wrong clash with notions of ambition and practicality.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The prose is unapologetically modernist: unannounced time shifts combine with a stream-of-consciousness style that can often be dense. Yet <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ford-madox-ford\">Ford’s</a> portrayal of shell shock, the politics of women in the 1920s, and the moral greyness of wartime is groundbreaking. The book, and its complete tetralogy—called <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/parades-end\">Parade’s End</a>—has garnered praise from critics and authors alike, with Anthony Burgess calling it “the finest novel about the First World War” and William Carlos Williams stating that the novels “constitute the English prose masterpiece of their time.”</p>\n\t\t",

It covers his life as a slave, enduring the whips of the overseers and the hopelessness of his circumstances, until his escape to the north and arrival at New Bedford, Massachusetts. The brutalities he witnessed and his slowly growing desire for freedom are presented in the vivid language he was already known for in his antislavery oration.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The eloquence of Douglass’s speeches caused some skeptics to doubt his credibility, believing that a former slave with no education could never speak so well. Thus, part of his motivation for writing the book was to dispel this suspicion and to provide a fuller history than was possible in his lectures. The abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips provided introductions vouching for the truth of Douglass’s words.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book was an immediate best seller. The fame brought danger to Douglass, who sailed for England shortly after the book’s publication to ensure he would not be apprehended as a fugitive slave. He spent two years touring and lecturing in Great Britain and Ireland before returning to America to continue his abolitionist work. English supporters raised funds to purchase his freedom from his former master.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The slave narrative is an autobiographical genre written by escaped slaves concerning their lives in bondage. Slave narratives not only promoted abolitionism by giving first hand evidence of the cruelty and hypocrisy of slaveholders, but also allowed African Americans to express themselves as intelligent, articulate individuals, deserving of respect and freedom. Douglass’s <i>Narrative</i> is perhaps the most important example of the genre, on the basis of its literary merits and its impact on the abolitionist movement.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> was <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/friedrich-nietzsche\">Friedrich Nietzsche’s</a> favorite of the books he wrote, and has been his most popular amongst general readers. Yet some scholars dislike it because of its unphilosophical nature: it eschews jargon and the scaffolding of arguments, which engage only the intellect, in favor of an artistic approach that engages the whole mind.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After ten years of solitude in a cave high in the mountains, Zarathustra wishes to share with humanity the wisdom he has accumulated during this time. He reaches the nearest town and addresses the crowd on the marketplace. He tells them of the Overman: the next step in human evolution, a being who creates their own values, freed from the weight of tradition and morality, and who takes responsibility for their own successes and failures. But the crowd doesn’t understand him; his discourse is met only with rude ignorance. Zarathustra then decides to gather a small group of disciples and share his wisdom with them.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The bulk of the book is Zarathustra’s speeches on topics such as morality, society, individualism, religion, and how suffering and its overcoming are what give meaning to our existence. While already wiser than most, Zarathustra still learns from those he talks to, re-evaluating his thoughts as he deals with disappointment (such as when his disciples prove to be mere followers), and confronting his own doubts. His greatest challenge, though, comes when he faces the existential test of the eternal recurrence of the same: the thought that our lives could repeat indefinitely without the minutest of change.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The inspiration for <i>Zarathustra</i> came to Nietzsche during one of the long hikes he often indulged in despite his failing health. It was a decade of solitude: his physical condition had worsened to the point of forcing him to retire from his position at the University of Basel, and each change of season prompted him to relocate to kinder climes in Switzerland, France, or Italy. The book took two years to write. Each of its four parts was written in a ten-day period of creative effervescence followed by months of gloom, plagued by terrible, debilitating migraines.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Zarathustra</i> was initially received with indifference at best and frustration at worst. It’s a work of philosophy as much as aesthetics: the language is modeled after the Luther Bible and contains numerous references to Homer, Heraclitus, Plato, Goethe, Emerson, and Wagner, to name a few. Later Nietzsche attempted to address the book’s lack of popularity by framing the same concepts in a more traditional, approachable manner in his following book, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/friedrich-nietzsche/beyond-good-and-evil/helen-zimmern\"><i>Beyond Good and Evil</i></a>, but that book also struggled to find an audience.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>With his health steadily deteriorating, Nietzsche’s mind broke down in 1889 and never recovered. His body would live on for 11 more years, and he ended up in the care of his sister, Elisabeth. A stalwart nationalist and anti-Semite, she saw in her brother’s illness the opportunity to turn him into a German hero. Despite her brother’s firm opposition to nationalism, anti-Semitism, and power politics, she perverted his work by promoting it for her own ends. Scores of commentators partook in her lie and enthusiastically used Nietzsche’s work to buttress their own contrary views. Doing so requires one to selectively ignore half the content of the book: Zarathustra’s discourses regularly touch on <i>a priori</i> dark and violent themes, but they also clearly state that these are to be directed towards oneself. Reaching the Overman requires us to know ourselves, and such introspection, given the darker side of human nature, leads to contempt. This contempt for ourselves, says Nietzsche, should be embraced as the first step towards awareness of what we could be. Cruelty, likewise, stems from that knowledge as a necessity to hammer ourselves into the proper shape. Such commentators also conveniently ignored Zarathustra’s many remarks about love: love for ourselves, he says, is what can prevent us from spreading resentment around us during this difficult process of change.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The first English translation of <i>Zarathustra</i> was by Alexander Tille, a German scholar who had emigrated to Scotland. English wasn’t his first language and his work suffered from it. Thomas Common, a Scottish scholar, used Tille’s work as the base for his own translation. Bringing <i>Zarathustra</i> to the English-speaking world was no easy task given Nietzsche’s stylistic idiosyncrasies. Just like Nietzsche, Common took risks: because the book is written in the style of the Luther Bible, Common decided to emulate the style of the King James Bible; he also tried to reproduce the musicality of the language and the new words coined by Nietzsche, some of which have been updated over time—e.g. Common’s “Superman” is nowadays known as “Overman.” While his choices have been controversial, he produced a landmark translation that faithfully tried to convert the unique flavor of <i>Zarathustra</i> into English. Published in 1909, it would take four decades until the next translation by Walter Kaufman in 1954.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But <i>Zarathustra</i> didn’t find its scholarly fame limited to Europe: soon after its publication, it reached Asia, where it was received with enthusiasm, particularly in China and Japan where it influenced the famous Kyoto School. <i>Zarathustra</i> has also received special attention from the music world. Nietzsche loved music and poetry, and it was his wish that this book be taken as music. No fewer than 87 pieces have been inspired by the book, in part or as a whole. The best known are Richard Strauss’ <i>Also Sprach Zarathustra</i>, the fourth movement of Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 3, and Frederick Delius’ <i>A Mass of Life</i>.</p>\n\t\t",

As well as novels (including the critically acclaimed <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/fyodor-sologub/the-little-demon/john-cournos_richard-aldington\">The Little Demon</a></i>), Sologub wrote over five hundred short stories, ranging in length from half-page fables to nearly novella-length tales.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While most of his short stories were not contemporaneously translated, both John Cournos and Stephen Graham produced English compilations and contributed individual stories to publications such as <i>The Russian Review</i> and <i>The Egoist</i>.

Borrow, born in 1803, was a writer and self-taught polyglot, fluent in many European languages, and a lover of literature.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Romany Rye</i>, published six years later in 1857, is sometimes described as the “sequel” to <i>Lavengro</i>, but in fact it begins with a straight continuation of the action of the first book, which breaks off rather suddenly. The two books therefore are best considered as a whole and read together, and this Standard Ebooks edition combines the two into one volume.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the novel Borrow tells of his upbringing as the son of an army recruiting officer, moving with the regiment to different locations in Britain, including Scotland and Ireland. It is in Ireland that he first encounters a strange new language which he is keen to learn, leading to a life-long passion for acquiring new tongues. A couple of years later in England, he comes across a camp of gypsies and meets the gypsy Jasper Petulengro, who becomes a life-long friend. Borrow is delighted to discover that the Romany have their own language, which of course he immediately sets out to learn.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Borrow’s subsequent life, up to his mid-twenties, is that of a wanderer, traveling from place to place in Britain, encountering many interesting individuals and having a variety of entertaining adventures. He constantly comes in contact with the gypsies and with Petulengro, and becomes familiar with their language and culture.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book also includes a considerable amount of criticism of the Catholic Church and its priests. Several chapters are devoted to Borrow’s discussions with “the man in black,” depicted as a cynical Catholic priest who has no real belief in the religious teachings of the Church but who is devoted to seeing it reinstated in England in order for its revenues to increase.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Lavengro</i> was not an immediate critical success on its release, but after Borrow died in 1881, it began to grow in popularity and critical acclaim. It is now considered a classic of English Literature. This Standard Ebooks edition of <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i> is based on the editions published by John Murray and edited by W. I. Knapp, with many clarifying notes.</p>\n\t\t",

It deals with two major characters whose lives intersect: One is a spoiled young woman named Gwendolen Harleth who makes an unwise marriage to escape impending poverty; the other is the titular character, Daniel Deronda, a wealthy young man who feels a mission to help the suffering.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>During her childhood Gwendolen’s family was well-off. She lived in comfort and was indulged and pampered. But the family’s fortune is lost through an unwise investment, and she returns to a life of near-poverty, a change which she greatly resents both for herself and for her widowed mother. The only escape seems to be for her to marry a wealthy older man who has been courting her in a casual, unemotional way. The marriage turns out to be a terrible mistake.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Daniel Deronda has been raised by Sir Hugo Mallinger as his nephew, but Daniel has never discovered his true parentage, thinking it likely that he is Sir Hugo’s natural son. This consciousness of his probable illegitimacy moves him to kindness and tolerance towards anyone who is suffering from disadvantage. One evening, while rowing on the river Thames, he spots a young woman about to leap into the water to drown herself. He persuades her instead to come with him for shelter to a family he knows. The young woman turns out to be Jewish, and through his trying to help her find her lost family, Deronda comes into contact with Jewish culture—and in particular with a man named Mordecai, who has a passionate vision for the future of the Jewish race and who sees in Daniel a kindred spirit.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The paths that Gwendolen and Daniel follow intersect often, and Daniel’s kindly nature moves him to try to offer her comfort and advice in her moments of distress. Unsurprisingly, Gwendolen misinterprets Daniel’s attentions.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In <i>Daniel Deronda</i> Eliot demonstrates considerable sympathy towards the Jewish people, their culture, and their aspirations for a national homeland. At the time this was an unpopular and even controversial view. A foreword in this edition reproduces a letter Evans wrote to Harriet Beecher Stowe, defending her stance in this regard. Nevertheless, the novel was a success, and was translated almost immediately into German and Dutch. It is considered to have had a positive influence on Zionist thinkers.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Daniel Deronda</i> has been adapted both for film and television, with the 2002 B.B.C. series winning several awards.</p>\n\t\t",

Her long novel <i>Middlemarch</i>, subtitled <i>A Study of Provincial Life</i>, is generally considered to be her finest work.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Published in eight installments between 1871 and 1872, <i>Middlemarch</i> tells the intertwined stories of a variety of people living in the vicinity of the (fictional) midlands town of Middlemarch during the early 1830s, the time of the great Reform Act. The novel is remarkable for its realistic treatment of situation, character and relationships and also demonstrates its author’s accurate knowledge of political issues, medicine, politics, and rural economy. Yet it also includes several touches of humor.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel’s main characters include: Dorothea Brooke, a religiously-inclined and very intelligent young woman who marries a much older man believing that she can assist him in his scholarly studies; Dr. Tertius Lydgate, a doctor who comes to Middlemarch to further his medical research and implement his ideas for treatment, but whose plans are thrown into disarray by an unwise marriage; Fred Vincy, an idle young man, the son of the town’s Mayor, who gets into a mire of debt; and several others.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The initial reception of the novel by critics was mixed, with a number of unfavorable reviews, but its reputation has grown through time and <i>Middlemarch</i> is now generally considered to be one of the best novels ever written in English.</p>\n\t\t",

He’s forced to write long, joyless novels that he thinks pop publishers will want to buy. These novels are draining to write, yet result in meager sales; soon Edwin’s increasingly small bank account, and his stubborn pride, start to put a strain on his once-happy marriage.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>His best friend, Biffen, lies to one side of Edwin’s nature: as another highly-educated writer, he accepts a dingy, lonely, and hungry life of abject poverty in exchange for being able to produce a novel that’s true to his artistic desires but is unlikely to sell. On the other side lies Jasper Milvain, an “alarmingly modern” writer laser-focused on earning as much money as possible no matter what he’s made to write, as he floats through the same literary circles that Edwin haunts.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The intricately-told tale follows these writers as their differing outlooks and their fluctuating ranks in society affect them and the people around them. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/george-gissing\">Gissing</a>, himself a prolific writer intimately familiar with the London literary scene, draws from his own life in laying out the characters and events in the novel. He carefully elaborates the fragile social fabric of the literary world, its paupers and its barons both equal in the industry but unequal in public life. Though the novel is about writers on the face, the deep thread that runs through it all is the brutality of the modern social structure, where the greedy and superficial are rewarded with stability and riches, while the delicate and thoughtful are condemned to live on the margins of respectable society in grimy poverty, robbed not only of dignity, but of love.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>Madame Bovary</i>, often ranked among the greatest novels of all time, is <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/gustave-flaubert\">Flaubert’s</a> first novel, and considered to be both his masterpiece and one of the most influential works in literary history, with authors from <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-james\">Henry James</a> to Proust to Nabokov heaping it with praise.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel tells the story of Emma Bovary, a commoner wife of a country doctor, and her attempts to escape the drudgery of day-to-day mediocrity by engaging in adulterous affairs and overspending on luxuries. She remains unsatisfied even though her husband adores her and they want for little, and her shallowness eventually leads to their ruin.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The story was first serialized in <i>Revue de Paris</i>, where prosecutors tried to have it censored for obscenity, arguing that not only is the story immoral, but that realism as a literary style is an offence against art and decency. The trial only served to increase the story’s fame, and when it was published as a single novel it quickly became a bestseller.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is groundbreaking in its emphasis on the psychological and emotional lives of its characters. Literature up to then had mostly focusing on the external events that make characters react, instead of focusing on the internal thought processes of those characters. <i>Madame Bovary</i> changed that forever. It was also revolutionary in its criticism of the middle class, which at the time was a still-new social class vying for elbow room between the working poor and hereditary aristocracy. Flaubert critiqued the middle class as being ambitious, shallow, greedy, materialistic, and totally without culture; Emma’s burning desire to reach even higher social strata, contrasted against that satisfaction being fundamentally denied to her by her middle-class nature, is an early echo of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karl-marx_friedrich-engels\">Marx’s</a> theory of alienation in industrial societies.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Today <i>Madame Bovary</i>, with its careful but charming description of the banality of everyday life, is considered the first great example of literary realism in fiction novels. Eleanor Marx-Aveling’s translation, though over a hundred years old, is remarkably fresh and smooth, and is a pleasure even for modern readers.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>The world of the 18th and 19th centuries had been wracked by change and revolution. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/gustave-le-bon\">Gustave Le Bon</a>, a doctor by trade but wandering philosopher by avocation, was a first-hand witness to one such revolution: the establishment of the Paris Commune in 1871, in which a crowd of mutinous National Guardsmen seized the city and established a socialist government for two brief months in what <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karl-marx_friedrich-engels\">Engels</a> called one of the first examples of a “dictatorship of the proletariat.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After that revolution, Le Bon left to travel the world, developing his theories on the psychology of crowds. <i>The Crowd</i> is his distillation of that philosophy, and one of the earliest treatises exploring the behavior and motivations of crowds of people.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In it, Le Bon posits that with the rise of democracy and industrialization, it’s the unreasoning crowds who will control the affairs of the people, not kings or the elite; and these crowds are largely irrational in action, conservative in thought, violent both in act and in speech, and easily hypnotized by individuals with prestige but not intelligence.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Le Bon is ultimately cynical in how he views this development in human affairs. Individuals in crowds feel anonymous and powerful, leading to destruction and violence; and the susceptibility of crowds to pure charisma means that they’re easily dominated by thuggish men of action, not wise men of foresight. People in a crowd are “a grain of sand amid other grains of sand, which the wind stirs up at will.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>His conclusion is that the increasing relevance and power of crowds in modern society will lead to negative outcomes in the long term. In his view, democracy can only lead to more and more violent crowds, who demand charismatic figureheads to give them meaning.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As one of the earliest examples of the study of crowd psychology, <i>The Crowd</i> was a direct influence on many titanic figures in 20th century history, including <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/theodore-roosevelt\">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, Freud, Mussolini, Lenin, and Hitler.</p>\n\t\t",

In a little over a decade he produced almost three hundred stories, many of which (e.g. “Boule de Suif,” “The Little Soldier”) are judged to be classics of the genre.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As a protégé of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/gustave-flaubert\">Flaubert</a> and contemporary of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emile-zola\">Zola</a>, Maupassant was an early practitioner of naturalism, and his stories often reflect the stark, harsh outlook that marked that movement. Brutality—towards women, as a result of war, or just representing the baseness of humankind—is a common thread. Yet stories like “Beside the Bed” and “Country Courts” show that he had a sense of humor as well. But no matter the subject, what sets Maupassant’s stories apart is his unerring ability to paint the details of the story’s setting and participants in such a way that the reader feels as if they are part of the action.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This edition includes all Maupassant stories that are known to have been translated into English, including five that have not appeared in any other English collection. It does not include the sixty-six so-called “fake” Maupassants, stories that were attributed to Maupassant but not written by him that appeared in several English collections at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>\n\t\t",

In the process, they discover far more than they expected.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As was typical for science fiction novels of the pulp era, there is little character development and women play a minor role, with romance given only a token treatment. The emphasis is on the conflicts over the spoils of the planet and the fiercely competitive search for the titular “cosmic computer.”</p>\n\t\t",

Seeking adventure, he places a newspaper advert with services offered in exchange for excitement, and a reply from a woman needing help piques his interest. What follows is a back and forth engagement with a shadowy criminal cabal determined to cause mayhem for the British establishment—and to profit from it. Luckily for Britain, “Bulldog” Drummond is up for the fight.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Bulldog Drummond</i> was the first book of ten by <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-c-mcneile\"><abbr>H. C.</abbr> McNeile</a> (writing under the pen name of “Sapper”) to deal with the eponymous hero; <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/bulldog-drummond\">a series</a> that was later expanded to nineteen novels and many further plays, films and short stories by later authors. The novel was an immediate success, with its combination of gentlemanly daring and high melodrama striking a chord with the public of the time. Drummond’s appeal to the modern audience has faded: he’s a character of his time, with views that reflect the British Empire’s thinking of the 1920s. His influence, however, lives on in later men of adventure, including James Bond and Biggles.</p>\n\t\t",

Kipps falls in love with neighbor friend Ann Pornick but soon loses touch with her as he begins an apprenticeship at a drapery establishment in the port town of Folkestone. After a drunken evening with his new friend Chitterlow, an aspiring playwright, Kipps discovers he is to inherit a house and sizable income from his grandfather. Kipps then struggles to understand what his new-found wealth means in terms of his place in society and his love life.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While today <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells\"><abbr>H.

Wells worked closely with (some say pestered) his publisher Macmillan to employ creative promotional schemes, and thanks to a cheap edition sales blossomed to over 200,000 during the first two decades of publication. It was during this period that his prior futuristic works became more available and popular with American audiences.</p>\n\t\t",

This Standard Ebooks edition of his short fiction includes fifty-four of Wells’ stories, written between 1894 and 1909 and compiled from the collections <i>The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents</i> (1895), <i>The Plattner Story and Others</i> (1897), <i>Tales of Time and Space</i> (1899), <i>Twelve Stories and a Dream</i> (1903) and <i>The Country of the Blind and Other Stories</i> (1911). They are presented here in approximate order of first publication.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The stories vary wildly in genre and theme, ranging from tales of domestic romance, to ghost stories and tropical adventures, to far-future science fiction. Interestingly, many of the stories deal with the exciting but also frightening prospect of heavier-than-air flight and aerial warfare, and it is worth noting that these stories were written some years before the Wright brothers first took to the air.</p>\n\t\t",

In contrast to Wells’ early speculative fiction works like <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/the-time-machine\"><i>The Time Machine</i></a>, this is a comic novel set in the everyday world of the late Victorian and early Edwardian era in England. Despite the less than happy life-story of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Polly, it is an amusing book, enlivened by Polly’s inventive attitude towards the English language.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Alfred Polly’s mother dies when he is only seven, and he is brought up by his father and a stern aunt. He is indifferently educated, and leaves school in his early teens to be employed as a draper’s assistant. As the years pass, he finds himself more and more disenchanted with his occupation, but it is too late to change it. Eventually his father dies and leaves him a legacy which may be enough to set up in business for himself. He sets up his own shop in a small town and stumbles into an unhappy marriage. The business is not profitable, and in his middle-age, unhappy and dyspeptic, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Polly comes up with an idea to bring an end to his troubles. Things, however, do not go as he planned, and lead to an unexpected result.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Wells’ later work often displays his passion for social reform. Here, that passion is less obvious, but nevertheless he demonstrates his sympathy for middle-class people raised like <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Polly with but a poor education and trapped into either dead-end jobs or in failing retail businesses.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The History of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Polly</i> was well-received by critics at the time of publication and was subsequently made into both a film and two different <abbr>BBC</abbr> television serials.</p>\n\t\t",

It takes a gentle, semi-comic approach to some of Wells’ social concerns by using the device of an angel fallen into our world from the Land of Dreams. This external observer, largely ignorant of the ways of humans and our society, is able to focus an unbiased eye on our failings.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The story opens with a strange glare over the little village of Sidderford one night, observed by only a few. But then reports arise of a Strange Bird being seen in the woods. The Rev. Hilyer, the Vicar of Sidderford, is a keen ornithologist. He takes his gun and goes out to hunt this unusual specimen for his collection. He does indeed see a strange flying creature, shoots at it, and brings it down. To his horror, he finds that he has shot and wounded a man-like creature with wings—in fact, an Angel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The Vicar restores the Angel to health, but finds himself incapable of convincing others that this person really is an angel. The continuing clashes of the Angel’s idealistic points of view with the harsh reality of the human world are the core of this story.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Wonderful Visit</i> was well-received by critics and Wells’ contemporaries. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/joseph-conrad\">Joseph Conrad</a> praised it for its imaginative approach in a personal letter to Wells.</p>\n\t\t",

In <i>The World Set Free</i>, atomic energy causes massive unemployment, shaking the already fragile social order. The ambitious powers of the world decide to seize the opportunity to compete for dominance, and a world war breaks out, echoing the looming Great War about to ignite in 1914. Waking to the catastrophe, humanity begins the hard search for a way into a better future. The novel traces a soldier, an ex-king, a despot, and a sage through a profound transformation of human society, and we gain a window into Wells’ own thoughts and hopes along the way.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>With one prophetic stroke, Wells gives the first detailed depiction of atomic energy and its potential destructive power, and predicts the use of the air power in modern warfare. He may have even directly influenced the development of nuclear weapons, as the physicist Leó Szilárd, shortly after reading the novel in 1932, then conceived of harnessing the neutron chain reaction critical to the development of the atom bomb.</p>\n\t\t",

He can’t abide or agree with their religious views and returns to his mother who sends him on to live with his Uncle, Edward Ponderevo, then a local pharmacist in a small town. Uncle Ponderevo, though, has grand plans, and eventually makes a fortune by selling a quack patent medicine he calls “Tono-Bungay.” George joins him in this endeavour and becomes rich himself, eventually turning his interests towards the new science of aeronautics. Meanwhile the Tono-Bungay scheme expands enormously and begins to topple towards its own destruction.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Throughout the novel, George comments cynically on England’s class system, the shabbiness of commerce, and the lies told in advertising. We also follow his unfortunate love life, his unwise marriage, his divorce, and his eventual reconnection with a woman he loved as a child.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Tono-Bungay</i> met with a mixed reception on first release, but has since come to be considered as perhaps Wells’ finest realist novel, an assessment Wells himself shared.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft\">Howard Phillips Lovecraft</a> was one of the most influential writers of horror fiction in the early 20th century. His fame is mostly posthumous: he was only published in pulp magazines in his lifetime, and never saw financial success. Despite that, Lovecraft’s unique blend of gothicism, horror, and the supernatural, set in an imagined but eerily-real New England, marked a gold standard for horror fiction for decades after his death.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Readers of modern fantasy and horror fiction will certainly recognize Cthulhu, the tentacle-mouthed god who lies asleep in a sunken Atlantean ruin; the <i>Necronomicon</i>, a grimoire of unspeakable power and horror penned by the “mad Arab” Abdul Alhazred; and the dark, twisted New England countryside of the Miskatonic Valley. These and other features take shape in Lovecraft’s stories, creating a backdrop of the bizarre and evil behind seemingly day-to-day lives. A thread of cosmic horror soon turns anything normal towards madness.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This edition is small because verifying the U.S. public domain status of Lovecraft’s corpus is a difficult, if not impossible, academic exercise, and finding first-edition copies to transcribe is also difficult. This edition will be updated as more transcriptions become verified and available.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Included in this edition are some of Lovecraft’s juvenalia—in particular, “The Alchemist” was written when he was just seventeen or eighteen.</p>\n\t\t",

He claimed that he didn’t have feminist intentions in the writing of <i>A Doll’s House</i>, instead aiming for “the description of humanity,” but the play is widely considered an essential feminist work and has had a real lasting impact: as recently as 2006, it was the most performed play in the world.</p>\n\t\t",

How <em>can</em> we all be right? Half of our wise men declare that the world is going straight to perdition; the other half that it is fast becoming perfect. Both cannot be right. There is only one thing in life that I must and will have before I die.

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>One of the most well-known and influential autobiographies ever written, <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> is told in the third person, as if its author were watching his own life unwind. It begins with his early life in Quincy, the family seat outside of Boston, and soon moves on to primary school, Harvard College, and beyond. He learns about the unpredictability of politics from statesmen and diplomats, and the newest discoveries in technology, science, history, and art from some of the most important thinkers and creators of the day. In essentially every case, Adams claims, his education and upbringing let him down, leaving him in the dark.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But as the historian David S. Brown puts it, this is a “charade”: <i>The Education</i>’s “greatest irony is its claim to telling the story of its author’s ignorance, confusion, and misdirection.” Instead, Adams uses its “vigorous prose and confident assertions” to attack “the West after 1400.” For instance, industrialization and technology make Adams wonder “whether the American people knew where they were driving.” And in one famous chapter, “The Dynamo and the Virgin,” he contrasts the rise of electricity and the power it brings with the strength and resilience of religious belief in the Middle Ages.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The grandson and great-grandson of two presidents and the son of a politician and diplomat who served under Lincoln as minister to Great Britain, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-adams\">Adams</a> was born into immense privilege, as he knew well: “Probably no child, born in the year, held better cards than he.” After growing up a Boston Brahmin, he worked as a journalist, historian, and professor, moving in early middle age to Washington.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Although Adams distributed a privately printed edition of a hundred copies of <i>The Education</i> for friends and family in 1907, it wasn’t published more widely until 1918, the year he died. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1919, and in 1999 a Modern Library panel placed it first on its list of the best nonfiction books published in the twentieth century.</p>\n\t\t",

Many of his essays touch on subjects similar to his famous book: long walks through nature, things found in moonlight that are invisible and unheard during the day, his preference for wild apples over domestic ones. In many ways he prefigured environmentalism, expressing his love for untouched nature and lamenting what the encroachment of man and cities were doing to it.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>He also had strong opinions on many other subjects. One of his most famous essays, “On the Duty of Civil Disobedience,” was written as a result of his going to jail for refusing to pay several years’ worth of poll taxes. One of the primary reasons for his refusal was his holding the government in contempt for its support of slavery, and several of his other essays express support and admiration for John Brown, who thought to start a slave revolt when he attacked Harper’s Ferry in 1859.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Whether discussing trees in a forest, slavery, or the works of Thomas Carlyle, Thoreau’s essays are deeply personal and full of keen observations, often in poetic language. They give a sense of the man expressing them as being much more than the views being expressed.</p>\n\t\t",

It explores why the economy of the mid-to-late 1800s had seen a simultaneous economic growth and growth in poverty. The book’s appeal was in its balance of moral and economic arguments, challenging the popular notion that the poor, through uncontrolled population growth, were responsible for their own woes. Inspired by his years living in San Francisco and his own experience with privation, George argues instead that poverty had grown due to the increasing speculation and monopolization of land, as landowners had captured the increases in growth, investment, and productivity through the rising cost of rent.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>To solve this, George proposes the complete taxation of the unimproved value of land, thus returning the value of land, created through location, to the community. This solution would incentivize individuals to use the land they own productively and remove the tendency to speculate upon land’s increasing value. George’s argument was profoundly liberal, as individuals retain the right to own land and enjoy the profits generated from production upon it.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Progress and Poverty</i> was hugely popular in the 1890s, being outsold only by the Bible. It inspired the Single Tax Movement, and influenced a wide range of intellectuals and policymakers in the early 1900s including <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy\">Leo Tolstoy</a>, Albert Einstein, and Winston Churchill.</p>\n\t\t",

After their marriage, his wife maintains a close relationship with her father, while their own relationship becomes strained.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Completed in 1904, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-james\">Henry James</a> himself considered <i>The Golden Bowl</i> one of his best novels, and it remains one of critics’ favorites.

The novel focuses almost entirely on four central characters, and explores themes of marriage and adultery in an intricate psychological study, which some critics have even suggested anticipates the style of stream-of-consciousness writing.</p>\n\t\t",

She wishes to spend her last days on happy adventures through Europe, and her sparkling personality, still bright despite her looming death, quickly makes her a hit in the London social scene.

He later wrote that the novel was his attempt to immortalize her memory, and that he spent years developing the core of the book’s conceit before committing it to the page. The novel is James at his peak: dizzyingly complex prose weaves rich, impressionistic character studies, heavy in symbolism and allusion, amid the glamorous backdrops of high-society London and decaying Venetian grandeur.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero</i> was first published in Polish as <i>Quo vadis. Powieść z czasów Nerona</i>. Among <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henryk-sienkiewicz/\">Henryk Sienkiewicz’s</a> inspirations was the painting <i>Nero’s Torches</i> (<i>Pochodnie Nerona</i>) by fellow Pole Henryk Siemiradzki; the painting, which depicts cruel persecution of Christians, serves as the cover art for this ebook edition. Sienkiewicz incorporates extensive historical detail into the plot, and notable historical figures serve as prominent characters, including the apostles Simon Peter and Paul of Tarsus, Gaius Petronius Arbiter, Ofonius Tigellinus, and the infamous Nero himself. Sienkiewicz used the historical basis of the novel as an opportunity to describe in detail the lives of the citizenry under Nero’s cruel and erratic rule.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Sienkiewicz was awarded the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature in part for his authorship of <i>Quo Vadis</i>. The book was exceedingly popular both domestically and internationally: it was translated into more than 50 languages, sold 800,000 copies in the U.S. within a period of eighteenth months, and was the best selling book of 1900 in France.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The plot of <i>Quo Vadis</i> follows the love story of Marcus Vinicius and Lygia. He is a young, charming, up-and-coming Roman patrician; she is a high-ranking hostage, a former princess of a country conquered by Rome. Vinicius’s immediate infatuation with Lygia is complicated by her devout Christianity, a faith barely tolerated in Rome of the time. As the painting that inspired the novel foreshadows, Rome burns in a great fire, and Christians receive the blame. The subsequent persecution of the Christians in Rome serves as the main obstacle between the two lovers.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Sienkiewicz portrays a pro-Christian narrative throughout the book, with the apostles Peter and Paul serving as spiritual mentors to both Vinicius and Lygia. The novel’s title translates to “Where are you going, Lord?”, a quote from the apocryphal Christian text the Acts of Peter, which depicts Peter’s death. The text describes how while fleeing Rome, Peter asks a vision of Jesus the titular question, to which Jesus replies that he is returning to Rome to lead the Christians since Peter, their leader, is deserting them. Peter then realizes he must turn back and remain with his people, despite the cost. <i>Quo Vadis</i> depicts this exchange, along with Paul’s fate and the deaths of Nero and Petronius, Vinicius’s wise and worldly uncle and mentor. Sienkiewicz contrasts Petronius’s and Nero’s hedonism with Vinicius’s and Lygia’s journey to a deeper faith in their God, and with Peter and Paul’s faithful martyrdom, to great effect. As such, the novel is not just a love story, but also a thoughtful reflection on how one’s way of living affects how they see death.</p>\n\t\t",

When the situation reaches its inevitable breaking point, it sparks the taking up of arms by the Cossacks against the Polish nobility and a spiral of violence that engulfs the entire state. This background provides the canvas for vividly painted narratives of heroism and heartbreak of both the knights and the hetmans swept up in the struggle.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henryk-sienkiewicz\">Henryk Sienkiewicz</a> had spent most of his adult life as a journalist and editor, but turned his attention back to historical fiction in an attempt to lift the spirits and imbue a sense of nationalism to the partitioned Poland of the nineteenth century. <i>With Fire and Sword</i> is the first of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/the-trilogy\">a trilogy of novels</a> dealing with the events of the Khmelnytsky Uprising and the following wars of the late seventeenth century, and weaves fictional characters and events in among historical fact. While there is some contention about the fairness of the portrayal of Polish and Ukrainian belligerents, the novel certainly isn’t one-sided: all factions indulge in brutal violence in an attempt to sway the tide of war, and their grievances are clearly depicted.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The initial serialization and later publication of the novel proved hugely popular, and in Poland the Trilogy has remained so ever since.

Part adventure story, part quest for vengeance, part biological textbook and part whaling manual, <i>Moby Dick</i> was first published in 1851. The story follows Ishmael as he abandons his humdrum life on shore for an adventure on the waves. Finding the whaler <i>Pequod</i> at harbour in Nantucket, he signs up for a three year term without meeting the Captain of the ship, a mysterious figure called Ahab. It is only well into the voyage that Ahab’s thirst for vengeance against the eponymous white whale Moby Dick—and the consequences—become clear.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is semi-autobiographical: <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/herman-melville\">Herman Melville</a> had had his own experience of whaling, having spent a year and a half aboard a whaling ship and further years travelling the world in the early 1840s. Herman used the knowledge gained from his experiences and wide reading on the subject to furnish <i>Moby Dick</i> with an almost encyclopaedic quality at times. The literary style varies widely, veering from soliloquies and staged scenes to dream sequences to comprehensive lists of ships provisions, but everything serves to further detail the world that’s being painted.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Presented here is the New York edition, which was published later than the London edition and reverted numerous changes the original publishers had made, as well as including the initially omitted epilogue.</p>\n\t\t",

The racism displayed in “Benito Cereno” against the African slaves is somewhat shocking to modern readers given our greater understanding of their story, but was common in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>\n\t\t",

Pious Christianity, superstition, and pagan folklore are each real and important elements of Darby’s life and world.

The setting in a fictionalized Middle East provides deeply-Catholic author <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hilaire-belloc\">Hilaire Belloc</a> a “far-off land” in which to attack what he saw as the rapacious nature of the British businessmen, industrialists, and bankers of his day.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Each episode of Mahmoud’s life satirizes greed, from small frauds and outright theft, to market manipulation, money-printing, and funding both sides in a long war. Mahmoud justifies all his dealings as simply the way things are: “For Allah, in his inscrutable choice, frowns on some and smiles on others. The first he condemns to contempt, anxiety, duns, bills, courts of law, sudden changes of residence and even dungeons; the second he gratifies with luxurious vehicles, delicious sherbet and enormous houses, such as mine.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>First published in 1922, this satire fits into Hilaire Belloc’s growing advocacy for the economic and social philosophy of “distributism.” It was selected as one of four books by Belloc for <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arnold-bennett\">Arnold Bennett</a> and Frank Swinnerton’s influential <i>Literary Taste: How to Form It</i>.</p>\n\t\t",

It describes the pilgrimage he took to Rome as the result of a vow he made while visiting his hometown of Toul, in Lorraine, France. In his own copy of the book, dated May 29, 1904, he notes: “I wrote this book for the glory of God.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Belloc walked “two and a half hundred leagues” to Rome, over twenty-two days, and arrived in time to hear Mass on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul. As he walks, he quickly discovers the difficulty of keeping every vow he made before starting, as the days are long, the mountains steep, and his finances stressed. But the book is far more than a simple travelogue; alongside the narrative of the journey, Belloc wanders into topics as varied as the art of writing, life in the military, his Catholic faith, the middle class, literary criticism, music, poetry, and more. His unique politics and personality shine in his many digressions and asides.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Path to Rome</i> sold very well, and many critics have viewed it as the book that made Belloc’s name. His great friend <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/g-k-chesterton\">G. K.

But, he argues, this model was broken by the rise of capitalism in England during the reign of Henry VIII. Ever since, capitalism has been moving ever closer towards the servile state: the restoration of status in the place of contract, and a vast proletariat of wage-earners with few incredibly wealthy owners.</p>\n\t\t",

Durward, the primary narrator, is a detached and seemingly-objective observer of events; his friend Trenchard is a dreamy, clumsy, and naive man whose fiancee, Marie Ivanova, is serving alongside him as a nurse.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The narrative follows the unlikely group as they are embedded in the Front, treating casualties and cholera victims while dodging shellings and enemy ambushes. At first the group seems to get along well enough, until Semyonov, a dark, charismatic, hyper-masculine doctor in their company, sets his romantic sights on Ivanova.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As the medics desperately try to fulfill their duty among the brutal backdrop of the war, their intricate relationships become the centerpiece of a complex emotional narrative that winds through the dark forest, a symbol of the confusing shadows that can lie between even two people bonded by wartime.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hugh-walpole\">Walpole</a> served in the Russian Red Cross on the Russian-Austrian front during World War I, and his real-life experiences are reflected in the narrative. On its publication <i>The Dark Forest</i> was called “the best picture of life in a field-ambulance on the Eastern Front that has yet been written” by the <i>Saturday Review</i>, and it was popular enough for Walpole to write a sequel, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/hugh-walpole/the-secret-city\"><i>The Secret City</i></a>, which went on to win the <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/james-tait-black-memorial-fiction-prize-winners\">James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction</a>.</p>\n\t\t",

John Durward, the English protagonist from that book and a semi-autobiographical stand-in for Walpole, is visiting St. Petersburg (then Petrograd) when he runs in to some old friends from England. Through them he meets Vera and Nina, two young and bourgeois sisters, and Nicolai Markovitch, a downtrodden and ridiculous inventor. Semyonov, a brooding doctor who is the sisters’ uncle and a character from <i>The Dark Forest</i>, returns as a dark, viperous thread weaving through the story.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Durward narrates the lives of these bourgeois Russians as they love each other and fight amongst themselves in equal measure. But as they obliviously carry on their cozy, lamp-lit lives, the Russian Revolution breaks out around them. St. Petersburg quickly changes from a comfortable, elegant, and gently mysterious city to a bloody and cold scar across the face of civilization. As the air fills with the sound of gunfire and the smell of smoke and soot, Durward and his English and Russian friends become a microcosm of the chaos they find themselves engulfed in.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Walpole lived some years in Russia during the Revolution, working as a journalist, then at the Russian Red Cross, and later as the Head of British Propaganda in St. Petersburg. His intimate knowledge of both the city and of the turbulent early days of the Revolution give <i>The Secret City</i> a more than convincing air. It’s the first book to have won the prestigious <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/james-tait-black-memorial-fiction-prize-winners\">James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction</a>, and is considered to be Walpole’s most delicate and insightful work.</p>\n\t\t",

Determined to shun all contact with other people—demanding that even his live-in domestics must wear face-covering robes in his presence—he throws himself into an all-out celebration of the ultimate in artificial and unnatural pleasure. Surrendering to religious and profane literature, morbid paintings, overwhelming perfumes, expensive liquor, grotesque flowers, and reminiscences of his depraved past brings him unsurpassable pleasure, but his mental and physical condition may not be able to keep up.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>When <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-k-huysmans\">Huysmans</a> wrote <i>Against the Grain</i>, he did so to move away from the creative restrictions he felt the Naturalist school of literature imposed on him. According to him, “it limited itself to depicting common existence, and struggled, under the pretext of being true to life, to create characters who would be as close as possible to the average run of mankind.” Instead, he dedicated Naturalism’s attention to detail to just one extraordinary, perverse individual, Des Esseintes—fully expecting the resulting work to fail critically and commercially.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>That the novel would become a scandalous success, and would define Decadence as a movement and ideology, was far beyond his expectations. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde\">Oscar Wilde</a> was a well-known admirer of the novel, and drew heavily from it to write <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde/the-picture-of-dorian-gray\"><i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i></a>. During his trial in 1895, Wilde all but confirmed that the “poisonous French novel” in his work refers to <i>Against the Grain</i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on the first unabridged English edition, which was translated anonymously and published by Groves &amp; Michaux in 1926.

M.</abbr> Synge</a> first presented <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin on the 26th of January, 1907. The performance immediately offended Irish nationalists by seemingly insulting the Irish people and language, and the general public, by being an offense against moral order. Before it was even finished, it was disrupted by a riot that soon spread out into the city. When it was performed in 1911 in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr>, the play was again greeted with scorn and the company arrested for an immoral performance.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But as Synge himself attempts to explain in the preface to his play, rather than attack Irish Gaelic, he wanted to show the relationship between the imagination of the Irish country people and their speech, which is “rich and living,” and that his use of such language reflects reality in a way missing from other modern drama. He later insisted that his plot was not to be taken as social realism, but died in 1909 before the play finally gained broader appeal in the wider world. Since then the significance of <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> has been recognized and celebrated both for its characterizations and its rich use of dialect.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>The Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 leveled the city of Lisbon and surrounding areas, and killed perhaps as many as 100,000 people. It came at a decisive time in the history of western thought: the melding of Faith, Philosophy, and Science into a post-enlightenment rational view of the universe. In some sense mankind had just begun to believe he had the universe figured out when the universe struck back with a tragedy so terrible in scale it could not be fit into any box of understanding. It was not predicted. It could not have been prevented. It was not rational. And it certainly could not have been the will of a benevolent God.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Lisbon was only one moment in a much larger context—industrialization was upending a pre-historic way of life, science was upending nature, and the first great republics in America and France were about to upend previously unchallenged forms of government. It was the awe, inspiration, and uncertainty of all this change that gave rise, ultimately, to Romanticism in art, literature, and music.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/j-w-von-goethe\"><abbr>J. W.</abbr> von Goethe</a> is, by some accounts, the father of the romantic period in literature, or at least the proto-romantic <i lang=\"de\">Sturm und Drang</i> (“Storm and Stress”) period. And <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther</i> was its genesis. It was Goethe’s first major work, an immediate sensation upon publication, and made Goethe a household name.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/voltaire\">Voltaire</a> parodied rationalism in <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/voltaire/candide/the-modern-library\"><i>Candide</i></a>, Goethe transcended it with the semi-autobiographical story of Werther, a young man governed more by his emotions than his reason, whose only employment is his delight in the romantic ideals of the pastoral lives he finds in the rural town of Walheim. There he also finds Charlotte, and in her an idealized but unobtainable old-world domesticity. Werther’s internal dialog about his growing obsession with Charlotte, and his inability to cope rationally with the fact that she is engaged to—and in love with—another man, form the bulk of the book in the form of a series of ever more intense letters to a friend.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Werther’s descent into sorrow has captivated readers for centuries, helped by Goethe’s intensely beautiful prose (translated here by <abbr>R. D.</abbr> Boylan), enchanting imagery, and obvious reverence for nature and a dying past.</p>\n\t\t",

The manuscript is discovered in the year 2600, and is introduced and annotated by a far-future commentator.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In it, Avis tells of how the United States was slowly overcome by a group of oligarchs, the Iron Heel, who use their monopoly power to systematically bankrupt American small businesses and farmers in order to cement their control over the capitalist system. Eventually, the U.S. Army is brought under the control of the oligarchs, who entrench a brutal system of repression against the working class.

The novel is a witty, parodic send-up of the ideal of courtly love. Soon after publication, its bawdy style and double-entendre-laden dialog brought it to the attention of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, who promptly attempted to prosecute it for obscenity. After some years Cabell finally won the trial, and the publicity the trial brought made the book and Cabell famous. In his revised 1922 edition (on which this ebook is based) Cabell satirizes the Society in his Foreword, where Jurgen is placed on trial by the Philistines, overseen by a giant dung beetle as prosecutor.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The eponymous Jurgen is a pawnbroker and self-described “monstrous clever fellow” who, after passing by a demon and offering an offhand compliment, finds himself having regained his youth as he is launched on a magical, amorous journey. On his quest for love Jurgen meets a series of mythological and legendary characters—from Nessus the centaur, to Guinevere, to Helen of Troy, to the Lady of the Lake, and more. His wit charms all of them, though Jurgen never seems happy with whatever astonishing situation he finds himself in—whether it’s pestering the devils of hell or chatting with the creator in heaven.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is dense with allegory and allusion, but despite its erudition it maintains a brisk pace as puns and witticism zip by. It influenced a huge number of authors, including Fritz Leiber and Robert A. Heinlein, and was widely considered a masterpiece of its time, with personalities like Alistair Crowley proclaiming it an “epoch-making masterpiece of philosophy.” Its publication and widespread popularity and acclaim set the stage for the modern fantasy-comedy genre perfected by authors like Terry Pratchett and Piers Anthony.</p>\n\t\t",

The novel is written in a modernist style, with dialog and narration blending together in a kind of stream-of-consciousness meant to invoke the blurriness of memory.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Joyce originally planned writing a realist autobiographical novel of 63 chapters titled <i>Stephen Hero</i>. He abandoned the attempt halfway through, and refocused his efforts on <i>Portrait</i>, a shorter, sharper work in the modernist style. His alter-ego remained Stephen Dedalus, named after Daedalus, the mythological Greek craftsman and father of Icarus. <i>Portrait</i> was written while he was waiting for <i>Dubliners</i> to be published, a process that took eight years and so frustrated Joyce that he once threw the manuscript of <i>Portrait</i> into a fire, causing his family to run to save it.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel closely traces Joyce’s early years. Like his alter-ego Stephen, Joyce was born into a middle-class family and lived in Dublin as they descended into poverty; he rebelled against his Irish Catholic upbringing to become a star student at Dublin University, and put aside thoughts of priesthood or medicine, the other careers offered him, to become a writer. Joyce doesn’t shy away from sensitive topics, presenting the discoveries of youth in all of their physical detail, including Stephen’s teenage visits to prostitutes (which also mirror Joyce’s youth, and were how he probably contracted the suspected syphilis that plagued his vision and tortured his health for the rest of his life), and the homosexual explorations of children at a Jesuit school.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The writing is in the free indirect style, allowing the narrator to both focus on Stephen and present characters and events through his eyes, until the last chapter, where Stephen’s first-person diary entries suggest he’s finally found his voice. As the novel progresses, the syntax and vocabulary also grow in complexity, reflecting Stephen’s own development.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Of Joyce’s three novels, <i>Portrait</i> is the most straightforward and accessible. But it remains just as rich and complex as any masterpiece, with critics across generations hailing it as work of unique beauty and perception.</p>\n\t\t",

It took Joyce nine years to finally see his stories in print, but not before seeing a printer burn all but one copy of the proofs. Today <i>Dubliners</i> survives as a rich example of not just literary excellence, but of what everyday life was like for average Dubliners in their day.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>Though <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce\">James Joyce</a> earned his literary fame mostly through his short stories and novels, he also published several short books of poetry. In fact <i>Chamber Music</i>, a collection of thirty-six short love poems, was his first major independent publication.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The title of <i>Chamber Music</i> is said to have come from the sound of urine tinkling into a chamber pot—though this was actually a story made up by Joyce after the fact. As he grew older, he came to dislike the title, saying that it was too complacent. Though the story of the title’s genesis suggests the poems are bawdy and raw, in fact they’re each gentle and lyrical love poems, strictly rooted in the romantic tradition. Though the poems didn’t sell well, they met with some critical acclaim from the likes of Ezra Pound and W. B. Yeats.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>“Gas from a Burner” is a short broadside published by Joyce in 1912. He composed it as he was preparing to leave his home, Ireland, for the last time, before embarking on a new life of exile on the continent. Its targets are his publishers, who for almost a decade stalled the publication of his short story collection <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce/dubliners\">Dubliners</a></i>. They frustrated him to to such an extent that he thought they were actively conspiring against him to prevent his controversial manuscript from ever seeing the light of day. “Gas from a Burner” crystallizes the rage he felt at that pious, hypocritical, and prudish establishment.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Pomes Penyeach</i> is a collection of poems Joyce wrote over the course of twenty years. Initially rejected for publication by Ezra Pound, it was eventually published by Sylvia Beach at Shakespeare and Company in 1927. The title puns on the French <i>pommes</i> (apples), offering them at a price in either language. Like <i>Chamber Music</i>, the poems have an often-romantic sentimantality to them. It was the penultimate publication in his lifetime, followed by <i>Finnegans Wake</i> over a decade later.</p>\n\t\t",

She’s perhaps most famous for introducing the Settlement movement to the United States and for founding Hull House, a hugely influential settlement house in Chicago.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Settlement houses were founded on the idea of uplifting the poor working class by quartering the rich and poor together in close proximity. By living together under the guidance of settlement workers, the poor would have access to communal education, healthcare, day care, food, and shelter, allowing them to improve their positions in society instead of being ground under heel by the privations of poverty and the brutality of workhouses. Immigrants in particular could take advantage of the settlement’s safety net, helping them naturalize more easily in their new country as they struggled to find stability while both working and raising children.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Hull House, named after the house’s original owner, was Addams’ life work. It brought together the urban poor—mostly recently-settled immigrants—together into a vast thirteen-building complex near the heart of Chicago’s downtown. In this book Addams describes the house, its founding, and its operations; because running the house was such a major part of her life, she considered this book to be her autobiography of sorts. Hull House remained open until 2012, operating continuously for over 120 years.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>For her work at Hull House and for her involvement in the Peace Movement of World War I, Addams was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the award’s first American woman recipient. At the time of her death she was the most well-known female public figure in America.</p>\n\t\t",

She needn’t have worried; it sold out its first printing of a modest 750 copies. She used well-defined characters, humor, and satire to paint a vivid picture of life in the England of George III, with all of its manners, class issues, and unwritten rules of behavior. That it’s still being read over two hundred years later is a testimony to her brilliance.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>Published in 1923, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jean-toomer\">Jean Toomer’s</a> <i>Cane</i> was widely heralded as one of the first masterpieces of the Harlem Renaissance, and its author as “a bright morning star” of the movement. Toomer himself, however, was reluctant to embrace an explicitly racialized identity, preferring to define himself as simply an American writer.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Inspired in part by Sherwood Anderson’s short story cycle <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i>, Toomer conceived <i>Cane</i> as a mosaic of intricately connected vignettes, poems, stories, songs, and even play-like dialogues. Drawing on both modernist poetry and African-American spirituals, Toomer imbues each form with a lyrical and often experimental sensibility.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The work is structured in three distinct but unnamed parts. The first is set in rural Georgia and focuses on the lives of women and the men who desire them. The second part moves to the urban enclaves of the North in the years following the Great Migration. The third and final part returns to the rural South and explores the interactions between African-Americans from the North and those living in the South.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Although sales languished in the later years of Toomer’s life, the book was reissued after his death and rediscovered by a new generation of American writers. Alice Walker described <i>Cane</i> as one of the most important books in her own development as a writer: “I love it passionately, could not possibly exist without it.”</p>\n\t\t",

In 1922 Galsworthy wrote two interconnecting short stories to bind the three novels together and published the whole as <i>The Forsyte Saga</i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While the novels follow the Forsyte family at large, the action centers around Soames Forsyte—the scion of a nouveau-riche London tea merchant—his wife Irene, and their unhappy marriage. Soames and his sprawling family are portrayed as stereotypes of unhappy gilded-age wealth, their family having entered the industrial revolution poor farmers and emerged as wealthy bourgeoise. Their rise was powered by their capacity to acquire, won at the expense of their capacity for almost anything else.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Thematically, the saga focuses on the mores of the wealthy upper-middle class, which was still a newish feature in the class landscape of England at the time; duty, honor, and love; and the rapidly growing differences across generations occurring in a period of war and social change. The characters are complex and nuanced, and the situations they find themselves in—both of their own making, and of the making of society around them—provide a rich field for analyzing the close of the Victorian age, the dawn of the Edwardian age, and the societal frameworks that were forged in that frisson.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Galsworthy went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932 for <i>The Forsyte Saga</i>, one of the rare occasions in which the Swedish Academy has awarded a prize for a specific work instead of for a lifetime of work.</p>\n\t\t",

They portray settings loaded with symbolism and sensuality, and draw heavily on Greek and Roman myth along with romanticised tales of chivalry. Keats died in 1821 at the young age of 25, having written the majority of his work in less than four years. While not appreciated during his lifetime, he has gone on to become one of the most loved of the Romantic poets, and has provided inspiration to authors as diverse as <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oscar-wilde\">Oscar Wilde</a>, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilfred-owen\">Wilfred Owen</a> and Neil Gaiman.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This collection includes among others early work such as “On Death,” the six odes written in 1819, his two epics <i>Hyperion</i> and <i>Endymion</i>, and “To Autumn,” now widely considered to be one of the best English short poems. Keats’ works are presented here in chronological order, and include the poems published in his lifetime and other unfinished fragments and posthumous verse.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-locke\">John Locke</a>, the English philosopher considered to be the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers, never married or had children. Despite this, in 1684 his friends Mary and Edward Clarke asked him for advice on how to raise their son. In response, Locke composed a series of letters to them that outlined his philosophy of education.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In 1693, encouraged by the Clarkes and by his friend William Molyneux, he compiled the letters into a single treatise. This treatise, <i>Some Thoughts Concerning Education</i>, went on to become the most influential works in educational philosophy in England for over a century, and was so influential on society as a whole that some critics consider it to be equally as important as his <i>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>. The <i>Thoughts</i> went through at least fifty-three editions in the eighteenth century alone, and inspired a movement for childhood education then-unheard of in Europe, ultimately resulting in the popularization of Victorian public schools.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the <i>Thoughts</i>, Locke advocates a practical education for a child consisting of exposure to foreign languages, gentle introductions to topics like reading and mathematics through game-like approaches, physical training and exercise, and rhetoric, all delivered by a competent and dedicated tutor. He placed the instillation of a sense of virtue as one of the most important parts of a complete education.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Education was to be administered through gentle encouragement focused on the child’s natural interests, and tempered with both shame and a feeling of awe for the parent. He argues that much of a child’s social education is received at a very young age from their peers and the society around them; thus, controlling the societal influences around the child is of paramount importance. All of this was starkly opposed to the then-common theory of education through rote repetition, enforced with beatings.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Some Thoughts Concerning Education</i>’s influence continues to the modern day, where its principles and techniques are embraced by Montessori-style education, and even television shows like <i>Sesame Street</i>.</p>\n\t\t",

This is a period of English history which encompasses the end of Oliver Cromwell’s Commonwealth and the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Perhaps reflecting some of his country’s turmoil during Milton’s life, <i>Paradise Lost</i> deals with revolution in Heaven by Satan and his followers against God, their defeat and banishment to Hell, and their subsequent plotting of revenge, leading ultimately to Satan beguiling Eve in Paradise to taste the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge against the explicit command of God. Milton’s vivid and poetic description of these events is both dramatic and compelling. The work gained swift acceptance and has always remained a popular and important part of English literature.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Originally published in ten books, a second edition was published in 1674 arranged into twelve books, the form in which it appears here.

During that time, Muir took every opportunity to explore the Yosemite area extensively—hiking, camping, writing, and sketching. Muir’s diary entries describing the land, flora, and fauna he encountered became the basis for the book <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>, first published in 1911.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Muir’s journal entries from that summer reveal his growing wonder and awe at the Yosemite landscape, as well as his endless curiosity for the natural world. On a grand scale, he trekked into remote areas for sometimes days at a time. He climbed Cathedral Peak and Mount Dana and trekked through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake. On a more modest scale, Muir observed the flora and fauna that surrounded him with the keen enthusiasm of a naturalist. He described in detail the area’s trees, shrubs, flowers, mountain meadows, glacial features, and animals.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the years that followed the publication of <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>, Muir went on to advocate for the protection and preservation of wild landscapes. In 1892, Muir co-founded the Sierra Club and became the organization’s first president. Muir also played an instrumental role in the establishment of several national parks including Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i> remains among John Muir’s most popular works. The book’s inspired and lyrical accounts of an iconic wilderness, written at a time in Muir’s life when his character as a naturalist and wilderness advocate was taking form, earns it a prominent, influential place in the annals of nature writing and the history of wilderness preservation.</p>\n\t\t",

The title comes from Jesus’ parable of the workers in the vineyard, wherein a landowner agrees to pay all his workers the same amount, regardless of how much work they actually did. Though the parable is an allegory about religious conversions, Ruskin analyzed it from a literal, economic point of view.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Ruskin strongly criticizes the 19th century economic orthodoxy, in particular the works of David Ricardo and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-stuart-mill\">John Stuart Mill</a>. He argues that their view of economics is flawed due to an implicit assumption that wealth can only be measured in money and material goods. Any policy or set of ethics that accepts this definition of wealth therefore neglects any non-measurable kind of value. The pursuit of this kind of wealth leads people to accept (or more often ignore) human suffering as a necessary part of the economy.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Unto This Last</i> remains a highly influential and often-criticized book. It was an inspiration to many prominent people, including Mahatma Gandhi, who published his own paraphrased Gujarati translation in 1908.</p>\n\t\t",

When not composing profound tracts that would shape philosophy in the next century, he wrote volubly in various magazines and newspapers of the day, became the godfather of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/bertrand-russell\">Bertrand Russell</a>—himself the 20th century’s most prominent logician—and even spent time as a Member of Parliament, becoming the first M.P. in history to call for women to be given the right to vote.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But perhaps the most interesting part of Mill’s rich life is his education. His father, Utilitarian philosopher James Mill, raised John in a special mode of education purposefully designed to produce a genius, with the intent of making John the standard-bearer of Utilitarianism in the next generation. To this end he kept young John isolated from his school-age peers to prevent them from making him feel too smart, and gave John a rich classical, moral, and scientific education. By the age of three John was studying Greek, and by eight he was studying Latin and in charge of educating his younger siblings; by twelve, he was studying scholastic logic, and had already consumed nearly all of the major Greek and Latin classics in their original language. That James Mill’s unique method of education produced a genius is without a doubt, and John’s youthful experiences are recounted here in detail.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This short and to-the-point autobiography is a fascinating window into the life of one of the 19th century’s most important thinkers.</p>\n\t\t",

It appears to have been first performed in 1612–13 at the Blackfriars before moving on to the larger and more famous Globe Theatre, and was later published in 1623.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play is loosely based on a real Duchess of Amalfi, a widow who marries beneath her station. On learning of this, her brothers become enraged and vow their revenge. Soon the intrigue, deceit, and murders begin. Marked by the period’s love of spectacular violence, each character exacts his revenge, and in turn suffers vengeance at the hands of others. Coming after Shakespeare’s equally sanguine <i>Hamlet</i> and Kyd’s <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, Webster’s <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> brings to a close the era of the great Senecan tragedies of blood and revenge. As the Jacobean period progressed, the spectacle became more violent and dark, reflecting the public’s growing dissatisfaction with the corruption of King James’ court.</p>\n\t\t",

The Los Angeles of this time is populated by four societies that must coexist, but that coexistence is out of balance.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The oldest and weakest group is the “natives” who live in the pueblo. Next come the clergy, the <i>friales</i> who first planted the orchards and who live in the missions. Then, the gentry, who live as dons and doñas on feudal estates, or haciendas. Finally, the land is ruled by the strongest of these powers, an unjust governor in San Francisco de Asis. He controls the army under whose rule the natives are abused, the <i>friales</i> mistreated, and the gentry disrespected. This is the story of a young man of “good blood” who decides he must restore balance to this frontier society.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/johnston-mcculley\">Johnston McCulley</a> wrote stories of Zorro for forty years. This, his first Zorro story, was originally serialized in a magazine as <i>The Curse of Capistrano</i>. Señor Zorro went on to leave a deep impression on popular culture, and has appeared in the work of many other authors and artists, in many media, ever since.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>One reason the character of Zorro endures is that he carries on a tradition of daring and heroic figures, both literary and historic, who precede him. Best known perhaps are the medieval Robin Hood of English folklore whose “merry men” are reminiscent of Zorro’s “avengers,” and the <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/scarlet-pimpernel\">Scarlet Pimpernel</a> of revolutionary France. Lesser known is the real-life figure William Lamport, the “Irish Zorro,” whose statue still stands in Mexico City.</p>\n\t\t",

Examining the question through both the lenses of Christian tradition and secular philosophy, Dymond argues that war is thoroughly incompatible with Christianity in its preceding causes, present reality, and following consequences. Much of the tract is dedicated to refuting the arguments of his opponents, such as claims that certain passages of the Bible sanction war or that the moral commandments of Christianity can be superseded on a case-to-case basis on utilitarian grounds of “expediency.” Dymond’s <i>Inquiry</i> was later cited by his fellow Christian pacifist <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy\">Leo Tolstoy</a> in <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/the-kingdom-of-god-is-within-you/leo-wiener\"><i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i></a>, further advancing Dymond’s argument that it is the duty of a Christian “mildly and temperately, yet firmly, to refuse to serve” in the military.</p>\n\t\t",

The story begins when the young British seaman Jim, one of the crew of the steamer <i>Patna</i>, abandons the ship while it’s in distress. The resulting censure prevents Jim from finding stable employment, until a captain named Marlow suggests he find his future in Patusan, a small village on a remote island in the South Seas. There he’s able to earn the respect of the islanders and is dubbed “Lord Jim.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The abandoning of the <i>Patna</i> by its crew is said to have been based on the real-life abandoning of the S.S. <i>Jeddah</i> in 1880. <i>Lord Jim</i> explores issues of colonialism, dreams of heroism, guilt, failure, and redemption. The book is remarkable for its unusual nested narrative structure, in which Captain Marlow and a number of other characters provide multiple perspectives of the protagonist. The gradual build-up of their richly described viewpoints imparts glimpses of Jim’s inner life, yet ultimately leaves him unknowable.</p>\n\t\t",

It purports to be a series of diary entries by the author, selected at approximately one-month intervals during late 1883 and early 1884. “Tom Collins” travels rural New South Wales and Victoria, interacting and talking at length with a variety of characters including the drivers of bullock-teams, itinerant swagmen, boundary riders, and squatters (the owners of large rural properties). The novel is full of entertaining and sometimes melancholy incidents mixed with the philosophical ramblings of the author and his frequent quotations from Shakespeare and poetry. Its depictions of the Australian bush, the rural lifestyle, and the depredations of drought are vivid.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Furphy is sometimes called the “Father of the Australian Novel,” and <i>Such Is Life</i> is considered a classic of Australian literature.</p>\n\t\t",

It inspired many similar works and adaptations. First published in 1864 in French as <i lang=\"fr\">Voyage au centre de la Terre</i>, it was quickly translated to English by several different publishers in the 1870s. The current edition was based on the translation by Frederick Amadeus Malleson that was published by Ward Lock &amp; Co <abbr>Ltd.</abbr> in 1877.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Our protagonist is Axel, whose overcautious and unadventurous spirit contrasts with that of his uncle Professor Otto Lidenbrock, an eccentric professor of geology. When Professor Lidenbrock obtains a mysterious runic-coded note in the manuscript of an Icelandic saga, he is determined to decipher it. Axel inadvertently solves the code and, much to his chagrin, discovers that it is a set of directions left by a sixteenth-century Icelandic alchemist to reach the center of the earth via the volcano Snæfelljökull. Reluctantly, Axel joins his uncle on a trip to Iceland, and with the aid of a local guide, Hans, begins an adventure towards the center of the earth, where they will encounter giant mushrooms and insects, an island with an enormous geyser, and battle pre-historic reptiles. One of Verne’s most well-known works, this novel is a testament to Verne’s love of geology, science, and cryptography.</p>\n\t\t",

The attention to detail and the accuracy of both the physical and geographical depictions of Siberia was noted by contemporaries, though it’s also said that Verne took some dramatic license in recreating some of the historical events.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Contemporary critics agreed that <i>Michael Strogoff</i> is a thrilling tale of the strength of men, of patriotism, and of the devotion of one human being to another.

The corporation has been manufacturing artificial beings which resemble humans, but who are tireless workers. They can be mass-produced in large numbers and are being adopted as workers in many countries. In the first scene of the play, they are visited by a young woman, Helena Glory, who aspires to relieve the lot of the robots, who she sees as oppressed. However, in what must be the fastest seduction scene in all drama, she is wooed and agrees to marry Harry Domin, the factory manager, who she has just met. She still however aspires to improve the life of robots and find a way to give them souls. Ultimately, however, this admirable desire leads to disaster for humankind.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play was translated into English, and slightly abridged, by Paul Selver and Nigel Playfair in 1923.

The time spent with a younger friend on a summer holiday on Grand Isle in Lousiana unlocks a feeling in her that she can’t close away again. On returning to her family home in New Orleans, she starts to transition from unthinking housewife and mother into something freer and more confident, although this doesn’t meet with the full approval of the society she’s a part of.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/kate-chopin\">Kate Chopin</a> had written a novel previously, but she was mostly known as a writer of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/kate-chopin/short-fiction\">Louisiana-set short stories</a>. <i>The Awakening</i>, while keeping the setting, charted new territory with its themes of marital infidelity and less-than-perfect devotion of a mother to her children. The consequent critical reception was less than enthusiastic—hardly surprising given the prevailing moral atmosphere of the time—and her next novel was cancelled. <i>The Awakening</i> was rediscovered in the 1960s and is now regarded as an important early example of American feminist literature.</p>\n\t\t",

She was one of the co-founders of the Communist Party of Australia in 1921, and her status as a communist and a female writer led to her being frequently under surveillance and harassment by the Australian police and other government authorities.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>She wrote <i>The Black Opal</i> in 1921, and the novel focuses on the very close-knit opal-mining community living and working on Fallen Star Ridge, a fictitious location set in New South Wales, Australia. Life is hard for the miners as their fortunes rise and fall with the amounts and quality of black opal they can uncover. Black opal is a beautiful mineral with fiery gleams of color, much valued for jewelry. Finding productive seams of such opal is a matter of both hard work and good luck.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is a well-drawn study of the relationships of the people living on the Ridge, and the two main characters are portrayed with clarity: Michael Brady, an older man much respected by the other miners for this knowledge and ethical approach, and Sophie Rouminof, a beautiful teenage girl who is the darling of the camp but who abruptly runs away to America after being disappointed in love.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Despite the difficulties the individual miners face, there is a community spirit and an agreement on basic values and principles of behavior at the Ridge. But this community of shared endeavor is eventually jeopardized by the influence of outsiders, in particular an American who wishes to buy up the individual mines, operate them under a company structure, and simply pay the miners a salary. This conflict between capitalism and honest manual labour becomes one of the most important themes of the work.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>Growth of the Soil</i> was published in 1917 to universal acclaim. A mid- to late-career work for <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/knut-hamsun\">Hamsun</a>, it was celebrated for its then-revolutionary use of literary techniques like stream of consciousness, and for its unadorned depiction of pastoral life. Its focus on the quotidian lives of everyday people has led scholars to classify it as a novel of Norwegian New Realism.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Isak, a man so strong and so simple that he echoes a primitive, foundational “everyman,” finds an empty plot of land in turn-of-the-century Norway, and builds a small home. He soon attracts a wife, Inger, whose harelip has led her to be ostracized from town life but who is nonetheless a hard and conscientious worker. Together the two earthy beings build a farm and a family, and watch as society and civilization grows and develops around them.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Isak and Inger’s toils sometimes bring them up against the burgeoning modernity around them, but curiously, the novel is not one driven by a traditional conflict-oriented plot. Instead, the steady progression of life on the farm, with its ups and downs, its trials and joys, makes the <em>people</em> and their <em>growth</em> the novel’s main propellant. While the humble, homespun protagonists occasionally come into conflict with the awe-inspiring forces of civilization, more often than not, those forces are portrayed as positive and symbiotic companions to the agrarian lifestyle.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Hamsun was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920 for <i>Growth of the Soil</i>, one of the rare instances in which the Nobel committee awarded a prize for a specific novel, and not a body of work. It has since come to be regarded as a classic of modernist, and Norwegian, literature.</p>\n\t\t",

One day, Dorothy and Toto are caught up in a cyclone that deposits her farmhouse into Munchkin Country in the magical Land of Oz. The falling house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East, the evil ruler of the Munchkins. The Good Witch of the North arrives with three grateful Munchkins and gives Dorothy the magical Silver Shoes that once belonged to the Wicked Witch.

But of her novels intended for adult readers, <i>The Blue Castle</i> is the most famous.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In Valancy Stirling’s rural Ontario town, marriage is thought to be a young woman’s vital accomplishment. Yet Valancy, now in her late 20s, has never had a flicker of interest from any suitor. Add to this the oppressive home life she endures with her mother, and Valancy’s misery is complete. In order to find some relief, she builds a fantasy world in her imagination—her “Blue Castle”—full of love and beauty. Even this, however, fails to support her when her chest pains prove to be the sign of a terminal condition.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This traumatic discovery combines with Valancy’s inspirational reading to prompt her to take back her life—much to her relatives’ consternation. Undeterred, Valancy finds new worth and freedom in relationships she could never have imagined before, which bring their own surprising twists and turns.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>In <i>Liberalism</i>, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/l-t-hobhouse\">L. T. Hobhouse</a> explains the philosophy of what he calls “liberal socialism.” Liberalism, as Hobhouse defines it, is the freedom from coercion. Crucially, this means freedom not only from government coercion, but from all forms of coercion, including economic coercion. It’s important that everyone is free to grow and develop their own individuality within society, but the government has the ultimate responsibility to ensure that one individual’s freedom is not used to limit the freedom of another.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The socialist aspect of the philosophy is the belief that people are not purely self-serving and are capable of voluntarily exercising restraint when needed in order to help society flourish. Viewed through this lens, liberty and equality are not in competition, but rather go hand in hand. In a liberal socialist society, “any common life based on the avoidable suffering even of one of those who partake in it is a life not of harmony, but of discord.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Tracing the history of the idea of liberalism, from pre-liberal societies, to the philosophies forged in the French and American revolutions, to the concept of socialism expounded by <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-stuart-mill\">John Stuart Mill</a>, Hobhouse defends the progress of liberalism, while asking what the future of liberalism should look like.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>In this short novel, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy\">Tolstoy</a> fictionalizes the final days of Hadji Murád, a legendary Avar separatist who fought against, and later with, Russia, as the Russian Empire was struggling to annex Chechnya and the surrounding land in the late 1840s.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel opens with the narrator finding a thistle crushed in a blooming field, which reminds him of Hadji Murád and his tragic tale. As the narrator recounts the story, the reader is quickly thrust into the rich, colorful history of the Caucuses, and its people’s fight against Russian imperialism.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Hadji Murád is portrayed as a legendary and imposing, yet friendly and approachable figure. Despite his reputation, it seems that his best days are behind him; as the novel opens, Murád is fleeing Shamil, a powerful imam who has captured Murád’s family. Murád finds himself thrust between the invading Russians on one side, and Shamil’s vengeance on the other.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As Murád and his tiny but loyal group of warriors try to forge alliances in their attempt to rescue Murád’s family, they quickly find themselves politically outclassed. The Russians are Murád’s enemies, yet only they can help him in his struggle against Shamil; and after years of losses incurred by Murád’s guerrilla tactics, the Russians would like his help but cannot trust him. Shamil, on the other hand, is a deep link to the region’s complex web of tribal blood feuds, vengeances, reprisals, and quarrels over honor. He’s one of the few powers left standing between the Russians and their control of the Caucuses, but Murád, having crossed him, can’t rescue his family from Shamil’s clutches without the help of the Russians.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Murád’s impossible position, the contradiction between his legendary past and his limping, dignified, and ultimately powerless present, and the struggle against a mighty empire by a people torn by internecine conflict, form the major thematic threads of the novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel was one of the last that Tolstoy finished before his death, and was only published posthumously in 1912. Tolstoy himself served in the Crimean War, and the war scenes portrayed in the novel echo his personal experiences. As the story progresses, Tolstoy characterizes various real-life historical personalities besides Hadji Murád and Shamil, including Emperor Nicholas I, Mikhail Loris-Melikov, and Count Vorontsov-Dashkov, making this a fascinating piece of historical fiction. Despite this being such a late entry in Tolstoy’s corpus, it has been highly praised by critics both contemporary and modern, with the famous critic Harold Bloom going so far as to say that <i>Hadji Murád</i> is “my personal touchstone for the sublime of prose fiction, to me the best story in the world, or at least the best I have ever read.”</p>\n\t\t",

A humanitarian cause—the pacifist Doukhobor sect, persecuted by the Russian government, needed funds to emigrate to Canada—prompted Tolstoy to finish the novel and dedicate its ensuing revenues to alleviate their plight. Ultimately, Tolstoy’s actions were credited with helping hundreds of Doukhobors emigrate to Canada.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel centers on the relationship between Nekhlúdoff, a Russian landlord, and Máslova, a prostitute whose life took a turn for the worse after Nekhlúdoff wronged her ten years prior to the novel’s events. After Nekhlúdoff happens to sit in the jury for a trial in which Máslova is accused of poisoning a merchant, Nekhlúdoff begins to understand the harm he has inflicted upon Máslova—and the harm that the Russian state and society inflicts upon the poor and marginalized—as he embarks on a quest to alleviate Máslova’s suffering.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Nekhlúdoff’s process of spiritual awakening in <i>Resurrection</i> serves as a framing for many of the novel’s religious and political themes, such as the hypocrisy of State Christianity and the injustice of the penal system, which were also the subject of Tolstoy’s nonfiction treatise on Christian anarchism, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/the-kingdom-of-god-is-within-you/leo-wiener\"><i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i></a>. The novel also explores the “single tax” economic theory propounded by the American economist <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-george\">Henry George</a>, which drives a major subplot in the novel concerning the management of Nekhlúdoff’s estates.</p>\n\t\t",

This Standard Ebooks edition compiles all of Tolstoy’s short stories and novellas written from 1852 up to his death, arranged in order of their original publication.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The stories in this collection vary enormously in size and scope, from short, page-length fables composed for the education of schoolchildren, to full novellas like “Family Happiness.” Readers who are familiar with Tolstoy’s life and religious experiences—as detailed, for example, in his spiritual memoir <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/a-confession/aylmer-maude\"><i>A Confession</i></a>—may be able to trace the events of Tolstoy’s life through the changing subjects of these stories. Some early stories, like “The Raid” and the “Sevastopol” sketches, draw from Tolstoy’s experiences in the Caucasian War and the Crimean War when he served in the Imperial Russian Army, while other early stories like “Recollections of a Scorer” and “Two Hussars” reflect Tolstoy’s personal struggle with gambling addiction.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Later stories in the collection, written during and after Tolstoy’s 1870s conversion to Christian anarcho-pacifism (a spiritual and religious philosophy described in detail in his treatise <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/the-kingdom-of-god-is-within-you/leo-wiener\"><i>The Kingdom of God is Within You</i></a>), frequently reflect either Tolstoy’s own experiences in spiritual struggle (e.g. “The Death of Ivan Ilyitch”) or his interpretation of the New Testament (e.g. “The Forged Coupon”), or both. Many later stories, like “Three Questions” and “How Much Land Does a Man Need?” are explicitly didactic in nature and are addressed to a popular audience to promote his religious ideals and views on social and economic justice.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>What Is Art?</i> is an 1897 philosophical treatise by <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy\">Leo Tolstoy</a> that lays out his philosophy of aesthetics. Rejecting notions of aesthetics that center around beauty, Tolstoy instead posits that art is defined by its role in transmitting feelings between human beings. Furthermore, he argues that the quality of art is not assessed by the pleasure it gives, but whether the feelings the art evokes align with the meaning of life revealed by a given society’s religious perception. In line with his spiritual views set out in <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/the-kingdom-of-god-is-within-you/leo-wiener\"><i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i></a>, Tolstoy argues that the proper purpose of art is to transmit feelings of human unity and “to set up, in place of the existing reign of force, that kingdom of God, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> of love, which we all recognize to be the highest aim of human life.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Tolstoy makes a number of unconventional aesthetic judgments in the course of the book, dismissing such works as Wagner’s operas, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare/romeo-and-juliet\"><i>Romeo and Juliet</i></a>, and his own past works like <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/war-and-peace/louise-maude_aylmer-maude\"><i>War and Peace</i></a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/anna-karenina/constance-garnett\"><i>Anna Karenina</i></a> as “bad art.” In turn, he praises such works as <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens\">Dickens’</a> <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/a-christmas-carol\"><i>A Christmas Carol</i></a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/victor-hugo\">Hugo’s</a> <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/victor-hugo/les-miserables/isabel-f-hapgood\"><i>Les Misérables</i></a> as “examples of the highest art, flowing from the love of God and the love of man.”</p>\n\t\t",

But when an accident happens after Massala returns from five years in Rome, Massala betrays his childhood friend and family. Judah’s mother and sister are taken away to prison, and he is sent to a galley-ship. Years later, Judah rescues a ship’s captain from drowning after a ship-to-ship battle, and the tribune adopts him in gratitude. Judah then devotes himself to learning as much as he can about being a warrior, in the hopes of leading an insurrection against Rome. He thinks he’s found the perfect leader in a young Nazarite, but is disappointed at the young man’s seeming lack of ambition.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Before writing <i>Ben-Hur</i>, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lew-wallace\">Lew Wallace</a> was best known for being a Major General in the American Civil War. After the war, a conversation with an atheist caused Wallace to take stock of how little he knew about his own religion. He launched into what would be years of research so that he could write with accuracy about first-century Israel. Although Judah Ben-Hur is the novel’s main character, the book’s subtitle, “A Tale of the Christ,” reveals Wallace’s real focus. Sales were only a trickle at the beginning, but it soon became a bestseller, and went on to become the best-selling novel of the nineteenth century. It has never been out of print, and to date has inspired two plays, a TV series, and five films—one of which, the 1959 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer epic, is considered to be one of the best films yet made.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>Harriet Jacobs was born a slave in North Carolina, but, in her words, didn’t realize it until her father died when she was six years old. Six years later, when her mistress died, she was bequeathed to the mistress’ granddaughter, thereby coming into the household of the mistress’ lecherous son. Several years later she escaped, only to have to hide for seven years in a cramped garret that did not allow her to stand or sit up. She was finally able to make her way north, where she was reunited with her children. Many years later, after narrowly avoiding capture multiple times due to the Fugitive Slave Law, her employer purchased her freedom.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Jacobs, writing as <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/linda-brent\">Linda Brent</a>, tells the riveting story of her life in the South as a slave. She brings an unflinching eye to “good” masters and mistresses who nevertheless lie to, steal from, and continually break promises to their slaves, and to bad masters who beat and kill their slaves for no particular reason. Even in the North, after her escape, she is disappointed to find prejudice and degrading treatment for blacks. After having been convinced to write down her story, it took years to find a publisher who would print it. It was finally made available to the public just a few months before the shots at Fort Sumter that began the Civil War.</p>\n\t\t",

He brings her back to Erl and the couple have a son, but Lirazel has trouble integrating with human society. When a scheme by her father spirits her away and Elfland vanishes, Alveric begins a mad quest to find where Elfland went.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The King of Elfland’s Daughter</i> is written in the pseudo-archaic prose style for which <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lord-dunsany\">Dunsany</a> is known. Some contemporaries thought the style did not suit a novel-length work, but contemporary Irish writer George Russell called the book “the most purely beautiful thing Lord Dunsany has written.” The book touches on a range of themes, including the longing for fantastical things lost, the perception of time, sanity and madness, the fear of the unknown, and being careful what you wish for. Large passages are also devoted to hunting; the original edition even featured an illustration of a unicorn hunt opposite the title page. Neil Gaiman wrote an introduction to the 1999 edition, and Christopher Lee was a featured vocalist on a 1977 progressive rock album based on the book.</p>\n\t\t",

He was born in Vienna to an incredibly rich family, but he gave away his inheritance and spent his life alternating between academia and various other roles, including serving as an officer during World War I and a hospital porter during World War II. When in academia Wittgenstein was taught by Bertrand Russell, and he himself taught at Cambridge.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>He began laying the groundwork for <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> while in the trenches, and published it after the end of the war. It has since come to be considered one of the most important works of 20th century philosophy. After publishing it, Wittgenstein concluded that it had solved all philosophical problems—so he never published another book-length work in his lifetime.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book itself is divided into a series of short, self-evident statements, followed by sub-statements elucidating on their parent statement, sub-sub-statements, and so on. These statements explore the nature of philosophy, our understanding of the world around us, and how language fits in to it all. These views later came to be known as “Logical Atomism.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This translation, while credited to <abbr>C. K.</abbr> Ogden, is actually mostly the work of <abbr>F.

The translation was personally revised and approved by Wittgenstein himself, who, though he was Austrian, had spent much of his life in England.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Much of the <i>Tractatus</i>’ meaning is complex and difficult to unpack.

But instead of lengthy, glowing biographies, Strachey opts for short, witty, and biting biographies that skewer their subjects. All of them are portrayed with their human flaws and moral contradictions on full display, implicitly knocking down the sanctimonious visions of these former heroes (perhaps with the exception of Nightingale, who, while portrayed as an often-cold and mercilessly-driven taskmistress, nevertheless escaped with her reputation enhanced, not tarnished).</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The biographies are not only interesting for their wit, humor, and readability, but because of the windows they open to the issues of the age. Manning’s biography occurs against the backdrop of a time of upheaval in the English Catholic church, with concepts like Papal Infallability entering the picture; Nightingale’s biography shines light on the appalling conditions of war; Arnold’s biography is a lens on the development of formal education and schools; and Gordon’s biography reveals England as an empire teetering unsteadily, whose ability to influence and control faraway lands is not as certain as it might think.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Eminent Victorians</i> took six years to write and was met with glowing reviews on its publication.

In it, Strachey looked at four iconic figures of the Victorian Age and punctured the hagiographical illusions surrounding them. It seems only fitting that he should follow up in 1921 with a similarly unsentimental but fair biography of the person at the pinnacle of that era, Queen Victoria herself.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Thoroughly researched, with his references documented in hundreds of footnotes, Strachey looks at the life of the young woman who, when she was born, was by no means certain to become the British monarch. He also spends considerable time on her consort, Prince Albert, who, in Strachey’s telling, develops from a careless youth to becoming a truly remarkable and effective figure in British society, while continuing to be generally perceived as an outsider.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Strachey’s sardonic and witty style makes this account of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert an entertaining and very informative read.</p>\n\t\t",

It has never been out of print and has been the basis for a number of dramas and movies.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel begins with the return from the Australian goldfields of ex-dragoon George Talboys. Three years earlier, in the depths of poverty, he had abandoned his young wife and their baby in order to seek his fortune. He returns to England having made that fortune by finding a huge gold nugget. He enlists the help of his friend Robert Audley, a rather idle young barrister, to seek out his wife. To George’s dismay and overwhelming grief, however, he sees a newspaper notice of the death of his wife only a few days prior to his return.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>A year later, when visiting Audley’s relatives and after catching a glimpse of the pretty new wife of Robert’s uncle, George goes missing. Robert becomes increasingly convinced that his friend has met with violence and is dead, and begins to investigate. What he discovers fills him with despair.</p>\n\t\t",

He published the first edition anonymously, sensing that the controversial and then-pornographic nature of the novel would stun society. And so it did—the book was so sensational, so salacious, and so scandalous, that after he put his full name (and title, as a member of Parliament) on the second edition, his reputation hardly recovered for the rest of his life.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Monk</i> is a Gothic horror novel marked by an intricate plot, melodramatic characters, and scenes of shocking terror. It follows two plots: in the first, the celebrated monk Ambrosio meets a mysterious novice at the abbey—a woman, Matilda, posing as a man, who seems to have a powerful, irresistible charisma. Matilda seduces Ambrosio not just in body but in mind, and leads him down a path of darkness and brutal violence. In the other plot, Raymond, the son of a marquis, falls in love with a nun, and the two scheme to live together; but their plans lead to encounters with evil spirits, exorcisms, riots, dungeons, and more.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel was shocking for its time in its frank depiction of sexuality and sexual violence, demons, spirits, and scenes of raw horror; but just as shocking was its anti-religious sentiment and thesis that evil often triumphs over good. It sold so well and offended so many that just two years after its publication Lewis was forced to issue a bowdlerized fourth edition, in which any offensive passages were either muted or expunged. Despite this attempt at satisfying society, and despite at least one written apology, Lewis spent the rest of his days in a constant struggle to escape the shadow of <i>The Monk</i>’s reputation, which he never quite did—even posthumous assessments of him as a person sometimes concluded that the debauched excess depicted <i>The Monk</i> reflected a failing of his own personal morals.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition follows the full, unexpurgated second edition of the novel.</p>\n\t\t",

His work has been much esteemed by later writers of horror, from <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft\">H. P. Lovecraft</a> to Steven King.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The stereotypical Jamesian ghost story involves a scholar or gentleman in a European village who, through his own curiosity, greed, or simple bad luck, has a horrifying supernatural encounter. For example, in “ ‘Oh, Whistle, and I’ll Come to You, My Lad,’ ” a professor finds himself haunted by a mysterious figure after blowing a whistle found in the ruins of a Templar church, and in “Count Magnus,” a writer’s interest in a mysterious and cruel figure leads to horrific consequences. Other stories have the scholar as an antagonist, like “Lost Hearts” and “Casting the Runes,” where study of supernatural rites gives way to practice. James’ stories find their horror in their atmosphere and mood, and strike a balance in their supernatural elements, being neither overly descriptive nor overly vague.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This collection includes all the stories from his collections <i>Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</i>, <i>More Ghost Stories</i>, <i>A Thin Ghost and Others</i>, and <i>A Warning to the Curious and Other Ghost Stories</i>.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>The essential facts regarding Joan of Arc are well known. A young teenage girl hears voices that tell her she will deliver France from England’s oppression during the Hundred Years War. She manages to take her message to the dauphin, who after some persuasion places her at the head of his army. That army promptly lifts the siege of Orléans, throws the English out of the Loire valley, hands them another significant defeat at Patay, and marches all the way to Reims, where the dauphin is crowned King Charles VII. After an ill-advised and short-lived truce, Joan is captured by the Burgundians—French nobility who have aligned themselves with the English—and they try her for heresy and burn her at the stake.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain\">Twain</a> first became fascinated with Joan as a teenager. When he finally decided to write a book about her, he researched it for a dozen years and spent two more years writing it. It was, in his words, “the best of all my books,” and became his last finished novel. Although a work of fiction, Twain’s research was time well spent: the known facts of Joan’s life, and especially the trial, are very accurate in their depiction. To tell Joan’s story, Twain invented a memoirist, Louis de Conte, a fictionalized version of her real-life page, Louis de Contes. Twain has the fictional de Conte grow up with Joan, and so he is able to tell her story from her early childhood all the way through the trial and execution. The result is the story of one of the great women in history told by one of history’s great storytellers.</p>\n\t\t",

In writing about Tom, Twain drew on his childhood growing up in Hannibal, Missouri, infusing the story with his usual biting satire and social commentary. In Tom Sawyer and his friends, Twain created young men who would long outlive him. Not without controversy over the years due to its language and negative depiction of a Native American, <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> is arguably Twain’s most endearing, and enduring, work.</p>\n\t\t",

Henson’s story is a testament to fortitude in the face of debilitating conditions.</p>\n\t\t",

Not only is it widely considered the greatest Spanish literary work of all time, one of the greatest literary works in history, and a cornerstone of the Western literary canon, it’s also considered one of the first—if not <em>the</em> first—modern novels.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is believed to be the first ebook edition of <i>Don Quixote</i> to feature a full transcription of translator John Ormsby’s nearly 1,000 footnotes. Ormsby as an annotator deftly explains obscure passages, gives background on the life and times of 1600s Spain, references decisions from other contemporary translators, and doesn’t hold back from sharing his views on the genius—and flaws—of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/miguel-de-cervantes-saavedra\">Cervantes’</a> greatest work.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The story is of the eponymous Don Quixote, a country noble who, in his old age, reads too many chivalric romances and goes mad. After convincing his grubby servant, Sancho Panza, to join him as his squire, he embarks on an absurd and comic quest to do good and right wrongs.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Today <i>Don Quixote</i>’s two volumes are published as a single work, but their publication came ten years apart. Cervantes saw great success with the publication of his first volume, and appeared to have little desire to write a second volume until a different author wrote a spurious, inferior sequel. This kicked Cervantes into gear and he wrote volume two, a more serious and philosophical volume than the largely comic first volume.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Despite being written in 1605 and translated in 1885, <i>Don Quixote</i> contains a surprising amount of slapstick laughs—even for the modern reader—and narrative devices still seen in today’s fiction, including meta-narratives, frame narratives, and metafiction. Many scenes (like Quixote’s attack on the windmills) and characters (like Sancho Panza and Lothario) are so famous that they’re ingrained in our collective culture.</p>\n\t\t",

After several different versions were written and performed privately, <i>Tartuffe</i> was eventually published in its final five-act form in 1669.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>A comic tale of man taken in by a sanctimonious scoundrel, the characters of Tartuffe, Elmire, and Orgon are considered among some of the great classical theater roles. As the family strives to convince the patriarch that Tartuffe is a religious fraud, the play ultimately focuses on skewering not the hypocrite, but his victims, and the hypocrisy of fervent religious belief unchecked by facts or reason—a defense Molière himself used to overcome the church’s proscriptions. In the end, the play was so impactful that both French and English now use the word “Tartuffe” to refer to a religious hypocrite who feigns virtue.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In its original French, the play is written in twelve-syllable lines of rhyming couplets. Curtis Hidden Page’s translation invokes a popular compromise and renders it into the familiar blank verse without rhymed endings that was popularized by Shakespeare.

Its first printing of 2,500 books sold out in ten days.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is set in the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony between the years 1642 and 1649. Hester Prynne has had a child out of wedlock, and its father is a mystery. For her sin, she is made to wear an embroidered scarlet A on her clothes—for “Adulteress.” She now faces a life of unending shame in the stern and religious Puritan colony, in a part of the world where there are no others to turn to.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While the plot is simple, the novel is highly allegorical. It explores themes of sin, guilt, repentance, forgiveness, alienation, and legalism. Characters have symbolic names and appearances, and many aspects of the narrative can be viewed in a symbolist lens.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/nathaniel-hawthorne\">Hawthorne</a> initially thought the novel was too short for publication on its own; to pad the length, he included the “Customhouse” introduction. The introduction angered the residents of Salem, who thought the introduction was poking mean-spirited fun at them. This prompted Hawthorne to republish the book “without the change of a word,” but with a reassurance that the introduction was meant in good spirits.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel has been consistently popular since its publication, with it being required reading in many American high schools. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/d-h-lawrence\">D.

References to <i>Vicar</i> in Victorian literature abound: George Eliot, Austen, Dickens, Mary Shelly, Charlotte Brontë, Alcott, Goethe, and many more famous writers all mention <i>Vicar</i> in their books.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The plot concerns the titular vicar, Charles Primrose, a mild-mannered and forgiving man who lives with his family in a country parish. His prosperity comes from careful investments of his inheritance—but when one of his business partners goes bankrupt, the vicar finds himself suddenly impoverished.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Perhaps the reason for <i>Vicar</i>’s long-lasting appeal is its careful balance between its being interpreted as either a sincere sentimental novel, or a satire of sentimental novels. Primrose is an oblivious protagonist, totally helpless against the evil forces of the world that constantly buffet him and his family. Despite this, the almost-ridiculous plot always manages to find a deus ex machina to save him from his latest calamity. The plot is so unbelievable that the reader is led to think that <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oliver-goldsmith\">Goldsmith</a> <em>must</em> have meant <i>Vicar</i> as a satire—and yet the novel is so earnest that the reader is left wondering.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the end, Primrose and his family serve as warnings to the reader to not be as heedless and powerless as they. The family’s constant deliverance from the disasters they blunder in to are Goldsmith’s way of saying that life is really not so Panglossian as one might want to believe, and that bad things can and do happen to good people—though in real life, rarely does a hero appear for a last-minute rescue. This worldview, which is so contrary to the Victorian’s ideals of romance and sentimentalism, may be what made it so popular as a satire in that era.</p>\n\t\t",

So after seeing a blockbuster play about a gentleman thief, he’s ready to bet his friends at the Strollers’ Club that he could pull off a burglary himself. That night he makes friends with a real-life “Bowery Boy” thief, who helps him break into a corrupt police captain’s house, and everyone gets way more than they bargained for. Later, the action moves to the Earl of Dreever’s castle in England. There, the misunderstandings, threats, cheating, and confusion only multiply, requiring all of Jimmy’s wits and daring to clear up.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In this short novel, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse\">P. G. Wodehouse</a> takes on many of the themes his fans will recognize from his Jeeves and Wooster books: the ridiculous upper class, the frequent need to hide one’s suspicious origins (while uncovering those of others), and the importance of amateur theatricals, dressing for dinner, champagne, and true love.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>First published in 1910, <i>A Gentleman of Leisure</i> has also appeared in several other versions, under the titles <i>The Gem Collector</i> and <i>The Intrusion of Jimmy</i>. It was also adapted into a Broadway play that starred Douglas Fairbanks Sr., and silent movie versions followed in 1915 and 1923.

Jeeves is his extraordinarily competent valet whose name has since become synonymous with perfect service. The stories follow Wooster in his wanderings about London, around England, and across the Atlantic to New York, with Jeeves following in his wake and striving to keep his employer well-groomed and properly presented. Along the way Jeeves must somehow also manage to extricate Wooster and his friends from the various scrapes and follies they get themselves into.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>First published as early as 1915, the stories first appeared on both sides of the Atlantic in publications like <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> and <i>The Strand Magazine</i>. They were later collected into books or reworked into novels. Though only less than 50 of Wodehouse’s over 300 short stories feature Jeeves and Wooster, they remain his most enduring characters. They’ve been copied, imitated, and featured in countless interpretations and adaptations. A century later, these stories still are as amusing and entertaining as they were when they were first published.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/p-g-wodehouse\">Wodehouse</a> once described his writing as “musical comedy without music,” and <i>Love Among the Chickens</i> is one of the earliest examples of his trademark style. The narrator, Jeremy Garnet, is a mild-mannered author attempting to finish his next novel in peace and quiet. Enter Stanley Ukridge, a man brimming with endless schemes, who draws the narrator into his latest, “the idea of a lifetime”—running a chicken farm.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>With little practical knowledge, yet boundless ambition, they move to a country house and put the plan into action. Along the way, Garnet falls headlong in love with a woman on the train, and becomes consumed with winning her heart, despite formidable obstacles.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The original edition of <i>Love Among the Chickens</i> was published in the <abbr>UK</abbr> in 1906. This newer edition dates from 1921 and is described as “entirely rewritten by the author.” It is the first introduction in print of the character Ukridge, who would appear again in other short stories and novels by Wodehouse.</p>\n\t\t",

But, thanks to a Scotland Yard inspector brought in especially for the case, the boy is cleared and his promising career among the elite is left intact.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Along the way, Wodehouse gives snapshots of the everyday lives of various boys: from dealing with the idiosyncrasies of fellow students, to collecting birds’ eggs and sneaking a smoke in the nearby woods while avoiding capture by gamekeepers, to cranking out an underground magazine to raise needed funds. Through it all, the boys, along with their headmaster, handle things with wit and aplomb. Consistent with a worldview in which a man “should be before anything else a sportsman,” sporting contests figure prominently: a boy rises from the canvas to score an unexpected knockout, and another graciously accepts his last-second defeat at the finish line.</p>\n\t\t",

Though subtitled <i>Forty Years’ Recollections</i>, it covers a period of over 60 years, from his birth in 1810, to the later years of his career in the 1870s.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Barnum has an engaging style, and his autobiography is crammed with many amusing and interesting incidents as he tells how he learned to make money entertaining the public through circuses, “freak shows,” theatrical presentations, concert tours and the like. On the way he builds up an impressive fortune, only to lose it all through a fraudulous speculation perpetrated on him. Then he starts again, pays off his debts and builds up another, greater fortune. Though often labelled as a “humbug” or “a mere charlatan” it’s clear that the majority of his contemporary Americans held him in affectionate regard.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>However modern readers may be upset by Barnum’s rather cavalier treatment of the animals under his care in the various menageries and aquariums he created, and be distressed by the details of how they were lost in the several fires which destroyed Barnum’s Museums.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Also of great interest are Barnum’s philanthropic endeavours: lecturing on teetotalism; supporting negro equality; and funding civic developments.</p>\n\t\t",

In this book he sets out to make his fellow citizens a little wiser via a catalog of colorful characters and events, and mocking commentaries about how a sensible person should be more skeptical. He goes after all kinds of classic humbugs like ghosts, witches, and spiritualists, but he also calls humbug on shady investment schemes, hoaxes, swindlers, guerrilla marketers, and political dirty tricksters, before shining a light on the patent medicines of his day, impure foods, and adulterated drinks. As a raconteur, Barnum is conversational and avuncular, sharing the wisdom of his years and opening an intimate window into the New England of the mid-19th century.</p>\n\t\t",

The only problem was that he couldn’t speak English. Undeterred by this minor setback, Carolino decided to base his guide on a respected Portuguese–French phrasebook written by <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/pedro-carolino_jose-da-fonseca\">José da Fonseca</a>. He took the French translations of Portuguese, and used a French–English dictionary to translate <em>those</em> to English.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The result was an unintentional comedy of literal translation, as English phrases like “the walls have ears” became “the walls have hearsay” (via the Portuguese <i>as paredes têm ouvidos</i>), and “waiting for someone to open the door” became “to craunch the marmoset” (via a ridiculous misreading of archaic English, and the shape of the grotesque door knockers popular at the time).</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The entire guide was quite large, and not only was it of no practical use as an actual phrasebook, but its length made it too much of a slog to appeal as a comedy. But its legend slowly grew, until in 1883 it was republished in an abridged form as a book of humor titled <i>English as She Is Spoke</i> (a phrase which, incidentally, doesn’t appear in the book itself). The abridged edition, taking the comedic highlights from the long and tedious original, is the edition that became famous. This Standard Ebooks edition is based on that abridgment.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book’s absurd mistranslations were said to have made Lincoln laugh aloud when read to him by his secretary John Hay, and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain\">Mark Twain</a> said that “nobody can add to the absurdity of this book, nobody can imitate it successfully, nobody can hope to produce its fellow; it is perfect.”</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Plastic Age</i> can be read as an exposé on the moral failings of undergraduates in Jazz Age New England, as described through the four-year experience of a young man at the fictional Sanford College. Students enroll at Sanford to “acquire culture,” and do so at an age when they are “plastic” in the sense that they are changeable and meant to be transformed by the experience.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But, not all of the lessons of a college education are in the curriculum. To a student reader of the 1920s, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/percy-marks\">Marks’</a> novel would have looked more like a moral tale, critique, and guide to navigating the challenges, pitfalls, and possibilities of higher education. Marks was an English instructor at Brown University at the time of publication but also had experience teaching at MIT and Dartmouth from which to draw his descriptions of campus life.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book was popular, the second best selling novel of 1924. It inspired two motion pictures. But it was also controversial. The novel was banned in Boston and Marks was removed from his teaching position at Brown the next year. College administrators saw the novel’s setting as a thinly-veiled version of their own school and the novel’s portrayal of college life hit too close to home.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>A Sanford English instructor seems to convey the author’s view when he says: “Some day, perhaps, our administrative officers will be true educators; … our faculties will be wise men really fitted to teach; … our students will be really students, eager to learn, honest searchers after beauty and truth.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>But what Marks sees instead are uninspired teaching and advising, superficial learning, pervasive smoking, prohibition-era drinking, vice, gambling, billiards, institutionalized hazing, excessive conformity, and a campus life that molds its students into less serious people. The author seeks elevation but sees regression.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Some of the norms and expectations of the 1920s may seem dated to the modern reader, but important themes endure. Marks went on to write 19 additional books and late in his career, returned to teaching literature at the University of Connecticut.</p>\n\t\t",

He begins by outlining how animals, both within and across species, thrive not through individual fitness, but rather through mutual cooperation.

At the time of its publication novels were a new literary form, and Laclos chose to present his story in an epistolary style, composing the novel solely of a series of letters written by the major characters to each other. It was first translated into English in 1812 and has since become universally regarded as one the most significant early French novels.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The story is framed around the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, two narcissistic French aristocrats and rivals who enjoy games of seduction and manipulation, and who most especially enjoy one-upping each other. The letters they send to each other portray an interconnected web of seduction, revenge, and malice, and are interspersed with the more innocent letters of their victims.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Dangerous Liaisons</i> has often been seen as a depiction of the corruption and depravity of the French nobility shortly before the French Revolution, thereby making a negative statement about the Ancien Régime. But it’s also a depiction of the timeless problems surrounding sex and love, and a realistic portrayal of desires that are often beyond our control. As Laclos enjoyed the patronage of Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Orléans, and as other royalist and conservative figures like Queen Marie Antoinette enjoyed the book, it’s likely it wasn’t seen as a morality tale until after the French Revolution.</p>\n\t\t",

(Proudhon, an autodidact of humble origins who began his working life as a printer, relied on the scholarship for financial support.) Proudhon evaded the worst of the consequences thanks to the intervention of the economist Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui, to whom the second memoir contained in the book is addressed.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In this treatise, Proudhon contrasts the legitimate right to <em>possession</em>, in which individuals own the products of their labor and the necessary means of production, and the illegitimate right to <em>property</em>, the absolute right granted to proprietors by civil laws to “use and abuse.” Proudhon examines the implications of the right to property and concludes that, among other things, property is “impossible,” “homicide,” and “the mother of tyranny.” As an alternative to both the proprietary and communist systems of economic organization, Proudhon advances his anarchist economic theory of “mutualism,” in which a socialist society would be organized based on free market exchanges wherein the value of a good or service is determined by the time and expense it has cost the laborer to produce.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This edition of <i>What Is Property?</i> was translated in 1876 by Benjamin Tucker, who was a notable advocate of individualist anarchism in his own right in the United States.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>Alfred North Whitehead once said, “the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/plato\">Plato</a>.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>It’s hard to overstate Plato’s influence on the West’s philosophical heritage and its civilization. As the first philosopher whose works survived to the present day, his writings and ideas are often characterized as the starting point of Western philosophy. Nor was his influence confined to the modern form of philosophy—Plato also affected political, religious, and spiritual thinkers, including early Christian theologians.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Plato’s works are written as dramatic dialogues. His focus is often on following the argument itself—the “dialectic”—rather than working toward a specific conclusion. His mentor, Socrates, is frequently the principal speaker, but scholars still debate whether Plato was expressing Socrates’ views or merely using Socrates as a mouthpiece for his own ideas.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In general, there are forty-five major works attributed to Plato, and all but one are dialogues. Modern scholars agree that roughly half of those were definitely written by him, some of those are definitely forgeries, and the rest they’re still unsure about. In this translation Jowett includes all but one of the works that modern scholars agree are authentic, along with an appendix of selected spurious dialogues. Over time, opinion on which works attributed to Plato were definitely written by him has changed; the only work that modern scholars believe is authentic that Jowett doesn’t include in this collection is “Hippias Major.”</p>\n\t\t",

H. Tawney</a> in this treatise on the difference between an Acquisitive Society, one guided purely by profits, and a Functional Society, one guided by professional motives. In the former—which is largely the world we live in today—businesses are concerned only with making profit for their owners, who have little or no connection to the industry they own, and high-quality service and efficient use of labor is at best only a pleasant byproduct. Tawney contrasts this view of society with the latter society, in which businesses are run by professionals instead of owners. In this scenario, professional considerations not related to financial profit would lead to better service and higher efficiency, as well as happier workers.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As an executive of the socialist Fabian Society, Tawney was considered one of the most influential historians of the early twentieth century, especially in politics, where he was a major contributor to the British Labour Party. His influence extended beyond Britain as well, and he has been credited with influencing the policies of Swedish Social Democrats.</p>\n\t\t",

Swept ashore an uninhabited island, their initial efforts to survive soon lead them to a settled life in what seems to be a tropical paradise. However, their enjoyment of their new island home doesn’t dampen their desire to return to England, their homeland. As their planning and preparations to escape patiently unfold, encounters with visitors both native and European dramatically alter their idyllic existence. The dangers they confront threaten not only their hopes, but their lives—and ultimately lead to unexpected results.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Coral Island</i> is the most popular and enduring of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/r-m-ballantyne\">R. M. Ballantyne’s</a> prodigious literary output. It was met with acclaim on publication, and has never been out of print since. His own travels as a young man had taken him for a few years to Hudson Bay, and this experience formed the basis of his early writings—adventure stories for younger readers, boys in particular. Meeting with some success, he began to use other exotic locations for further adventure writing, giving rise to <i>The Coral Island</i>, written in the tradition of <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/daniel-defoe/the-life-and-adventures-of-robinson-crusoe\">Robinson Crusoe</a></i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Ballantyne’s work in its turn influenced others. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-louis-stevenson\">Robert Louis Stevenson</a> was an admirer of Ballantyne, and he acknowledged the influence of <i>The Coral Island</i> on his own <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-louis-stevenson/treasure-island\">Treasure Island</a></i>. In a different way, William Golding’s <i>Lord of the Flies</i> is the antitype of the “Muscular Christianity” ideal found in Ballantyne’s work, internalizing the evil which Ballantyne’s young heroes, for the most part, confronted as something outside themselves.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>With its vigorous narration, attention to detail of flora and fauna, and social and ethnographic observations, the appeal of Ballantyne’s most popular work remains evident, even while its role in mid-Victorian imperialism continues to be debated and re-evaluated.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>Widely regarded as one of the most important figures in Indian (and more specifically Bengali) literary history, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rabindranath-tagore\">Rabindranath Tagore</a> was the first Indian—indeed, the first person outside Europe—to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, largely in recognition of his “spiritual offering of songs,” <i>Gitanjali</i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Tagore himself translated the poems from the original Bengali, taking many liberties in the process. His English translation is rightly recognized as a work distinct from the Bengali original, consisting of major revisions, many elisions, and many poems originally published in other collections.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Tagore’s lyrical simplicity, vivid imagery, and themes of nature, spirituality, death, and transcendence combine to produce a truly unique, powerfully moving work of thoughtful beauty. For many who read it, Tagore’s words in Song XCVI ring true: “What I have seen is unsurpassable. I have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus that expands on the ocean of light, and thus I am blessed.”</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rabindranath-tagore\">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, sometimes referred to as the Bard of Bengal, was a poet, composer, and artist active in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. His poetry had a profound impact on Bengali literature—so much so that in 1913 he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Today Tagore is recognized for transforming Bengali art, moving it away from its classical forms by embracing the Bengal Renaissance. Though his artistic output spanned many disciplines, his most famous is perhaps <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rabindranath-tagore/gitanjali\">Gitanjali</a></i>, his collection of poems that he himself later translated to English. His impact on Indian and Bengali letters can be exemplified by the fact that two of his compositions were chosen as national anthems—“Jana Gana Mana” for India, and “Amar Shonar Bangla” for Bangladesh—and that the Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In these autobiographical sketches Tagore gives us windows into his childhood, his youth, and his blossoming as a writer and as a lyricist. He stresses that this is not an autobiography, but more like a palimpsest of memories: glimmers and shadows that illustrate his artistic development, not a strict record of his life.</p>\n\t\t",

It opened just a year after Sheridan succeeded the famous actor/manager David Garrick as manager and, after Garrick had read the play, he even volunteered to write the prologue—lending his much desired endorsement to the production. <i>The School for Scandal</i> was extremely well received by its audiences as well as by many contemporary critics.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The plot revolves around members of London’s Georgian society who delight in rumor and gossip and the infelicities and flaws of others. Although they draw their victims from their own membership, they let no action go un-noted or uncriticized. But as the plot unfolds events don’t always prove quite so titillating, and not a few find themselves victims of their own love of scandal.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The comedy of manners was a staple of Restoration theatre with William Congreve and Molière being its most famous proponents. After it fell out of favor it was revived in the later part of the 1700s when a new generation of playwrights like William Goldsmith and Richard Sheridan took up writing them again. Praised for its tight writing and razor wit, <i>The School for Scandal</i> skewered high-society with such spirited ridicule and insight that it earned Sheridan the epithet of “the modern Congreve.”</p>\n\t\t",

Laughter is replaced with a more sentiment-based set of comedic values. Steele’s model proved so influential that not until 1773 with <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oliver-goldsmith\">Goldsmith’s</a> <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/oliver-goldsmith/she-stoops-to-conquer\">She Stoops to Conquer</a></i> does the “laughing comedy” return to the English stage.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The plot revolves around Bevil Junior who, though promised to a young women by his father, has fallen in love with another. On his wedding day he discovers his friend Myrtle loves the young woman he is to marry, and he becomes consumed with jealousy.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Steele states in his Preface that he very intentionally wrote the play around a crucial “dueling” scene, attempting to nudge his audience towards more restrained and refined behavior, hoping that “it may have some effect upon the Goths and Vandals that frequent the theaters.” Whether it did or not is debated, but it certainly affected the nature of English comedy for decades to follow.</p>\n\t\t",

The centerpiece is the long poem “New Hampshire,” an ode to the state. Endnotes on its lines point to shorter poems in the “Notes” section, and the book is capped with “Grace Notes,” a series of short lyrics—some of which are among Frost’s most famous works. The poems are each a meditative brushstroke of Americana, presented in Frost’s trademark plain-spoken but carefully-considered verse. The collection went on to win the 1924 Pulitzer prize for poetry, the first of four Frost would go on to receive.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Included in this book is “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” “Fire and Ice,” and “Nothing Gold Can Stay.”</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/robert-sheckley\">Robert Sheckley</a> was one of science fiction’s most prolific short story writers. Though less known today than he was in his heyday, he was a giant of his time and was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula awards.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Even though many of his stories deal with serious topics, they are most widely remembered for their comedic wit. His writing was compared to that of Douglas Adams, who held Sheckley in high regard: “He’s a very, very funny writer. He’s also a stylist. Very few science fiction writers write English well. Robert Sheckley can.” Sheckley was also well-respected by Kingsley Amis who, in his book <i>New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction</i>, included Sheckley in a list with Frederik Pohl and Arthur C. Clarke, and said their volumes should “be reviewed as general fiction, not tucked away, as one writer has put it, in something called ‘Spaceman’s Realm’ between the kiddy section and dog stories.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Sheckley wrote about and pioneered many science fiction concepts, such as in his story “Watchbird,” where he explores the ability to detect murder before it happens—three years before <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/philip-k-dick\">Philip K. Dick’s</a> “The Minority Report.” Or in “Ask a Foolish Question,” a story about an all-knowing Answerer to whom people pose the ultimate question of life—twenty-six years before Douglas Adams’ <i>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</i>. Alongside these two stories, this collection includes all of his public domain short fiction ordered by date of first publication.</p>\n\t\t",

The concluding tales are set in the Parisian art world.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In modern times <i>The King in Yellow</i> enjoys a reputation largely due to the strength of its first half of macabre tales, but by no means does that make the second half less enjoyable.

However, despite these reservations, the book was an immediate success. In Canada, there were ten printings and more than 12,000 copies sold in the first year alone.

They are introduced to their father’s associate, known only as Captain Starlight, a clever and charming fraudster. After a spell in jail, from which he escapes, Marston, his brother, and father are persuaded by Starlight to operate as bank robbers and bushrangers.

Despite this, Dick and Jim also manage to spend a considerable time prospecting for gold, and the gold rush and the fictitious gold town of Turon are described in detail.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The character of Captain Starlight is based largely on the real-life exploits of bushrangers Harry Redford and Thomas Smith, the latter known as “Captain Midnight.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Regarded as a classic of Australian literature, <i>Robbery Under Arms</i> has never been out of print, and has been the basis of several adaptations in the form of films and television serials.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is unabridged, and restores some 30,000 words from the original serialization which were cut out of the 1889 one-volume edition of the novel.</p>\n\t\t",

She was inspired by the Roman comic playwright Terence, who wrote six farces filled with disguises, misunderstandings, and pagan debauchery.

Two are concerned with the conversation of nonbelievers (<i>Gallicanus</i> and <i>Callimachus</i>), two are concerned with the repentance of sinners (<i>Abraham</i> and <i>Paphnutius</i>), and two are concerned with the martyrdom of virgins (<i>Dulcitus</i> and <i>Sapientia</i>).</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This edition, originally published in 1923, includes an introduction by Cardinal Francis Aidan Gasquet (an English Benedictine monk and scholar), a critical preface by the translator (Christopher <abbr>St.</abbr> John), and prefaces written by Roswitha herself.</p>\n\t\t",

The twelve tales included are all humorous “origin” stories purporting to tell how certain animals gained their distinctive features. For example, “The Elephant’s Child” tells how the elephant gained its long trunk because of a baby elephant having its nose pulled and stretched by a crocodile.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The stories originated as bedtime tales Kipling invented for his daughter and told to her each night. The stories had to be told in exactly the same words each night—“just so”—or his daughter would complain.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Early editions of <i>Just So Stories</i> were illustrated in black and white by Kipling himself, which lends the collection a certain charm.

Knowing little of his parentage, he is as much a native as his companions, speaking Hindi and Urdu rather than English, cunning and street-wise.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>At about the age of twelve, Kim encounters an old Tibetan lama on a pilgrimage in search of a holy river. He decides to fall in with the lama on his travels, and becomes in essence the old man’s disciple. Not long after, Kim is captured at an encampment of British soldiers under suspicion of being a thief. His parentage is discovered and the officers decide he must be raised as a “Sahib” (an Englishman) and sent off to school. The interest of the British officers in Kim is not entirely disinterested, however, as they see his potential for acting as a courier and spy as part of their “Great Game” of espionage against their bitter rivals the Russians, and ensure that he is trained accordingly.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Kim</i> is a well-loved book, often being listed as one of the best English-language novels. Its depiction of the India of the time, its varied races, religions, customs and scenery is detailed, rich and sympathetic. And the manoeuverings of the players in the Great Game make for an entertaining adventure story.</p>\n\t\t",

In it he describes everything from battles against the Dutch and the intrigues of court, to the plays he saw, his marital infidelities, and the quality of the meat provided for his supper. His incredibly frank observations have proved invaluable in establishing an accurate record of the daily life of the people of London of that period.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Pepys eventually stopped keeping the diary due to progressive deterioration of his eyesight, fearing that continuing to write would worsen the condition. He did consider employing an amanuensis to transcribe future entries for him, but worried that the content he wanted written would be too personal. Luckily for Pepys, his eyesight difficulties never progressed to blindness and he was able to go on to become both a Member of Parliament and the President of the Royal Society, but he never resumed his diarism.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After Pepys’ death he left his large library of books and manuscripts first to his nephew, which was then passed on to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where it survives to this day. The diary, originally written in a shorthand, was included in this trove and was eventually deciphered in the early 19th century, and published by Lord Baybrooke in 1825. This early release censored large amounts of the text, and it was only in the 1970s that an uncensored version was published. Presented here is the 1893 edition, which restores the majority of the originally censored content but omits “a few passages which cannot possibly be printed.” The rich collection of endnotes serves to further illustrate the lives of the people Pepys meets and the state of internal politics and international relations during the English Restoration.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>Clarissa Harlowe, or The History of a Young Lady</i> is one of the longest novels in the English language. Written by <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/samuel-richardson\">Samuel Richardson</a> over a period of several years and published in 1748, it is composed entirely of letters. Though this may seem daunting, the novel is highly regarded and is considered by many critics as one of the greatest works of English literature, appearing in several lists of the best British novels ever written.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel tells the story of young Clarissa, eighteen years of age at the start of the novel. She is generally regarded by her family, neighbors, and friends as the most virtuous and kind young woman they know. But she is drawn into correspondence with Richard Lovelace, a well-born, rich young man regarded as something of a rake, when she attempts to reconcile a dispute between Lovelace and her rash brother. Lovelace, imagining this indicates her love for him, carries out a series of strategems which result in him essentially abducting her from her family, from whom Clarissa then becomes estranged.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Much of the correspondence consists of the letters between Clarissa and her close friend Anna Howe, and between Lovelace and his friend Jack Belford, to whom he confesses all of his strategems and “inventions” in his assault on Clarissa’s honor.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is thus a fascinating study of human nature. Much of Lovelace’s actions and attitudes towards women are regrettably only too familiar to modern readers. And while Clarissa herself may be a little too good to be true, nevertheless she is shown as having some flaws which lead to a tragic outcome.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on the 9-volume Chapman and Hall edition of 1902.</p>\n\t\t",

The novel is actually a series of interconnected short stories, with each one focusing on the life of a different resident of the sleepy, pre-industrial town. Though each story peers into the personal life of a different character, the common threads running through all of them are George Willard, the young reporter for the <i>Winesburg Eagle</i>—and a pervasive sense of loneliness, even despair. As the stories obliquely trace George’s coming of age, he becomes a symbol of the hope the town holds for the future as its citizens struggle against the oppressive smallness of their existence and their paradoxical inability to form meaningful bonds with each other in such a small community.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The stories in <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> are of a decidedly melancholy nature, but their real beauty lies in the vivid characterization of the big personalities living in the small town. The simplicity of Anderson’s plain-styled prose paints a rich picture, with each character precisely portrayed in all of their dusty down-to-earth physicality. One can almost picture the narrator as the whiskey-soaked voice of Tom Waits, rolling each syllable around in his mouth as the summer heat lies heavy in the twilight air.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Atmosphere aside, the stories are also unique in that Anderson creates narrative tension not with plot development, but with insights into the psychology of the kinds of people who choose, or don’t choose, to live in Winesburg. This makes the novel one of the earliest examples of literary modernism. It was praised by its contemporaries on publication, with H. L. Mencken stating that the novel “embodies some of the most remarkable writing done in America in our time.” It remained both acclaimed and widely read throughout the 1930s, when its popularity waned with the author’s own. In the 1960s critics reevaluated it, firmly placing it in the canon of modern American classics.</p>\n\t\t",

Perhaps unsurprisingly, none of them emerge unscathed from this upbringing, although the damage manifests itself in different and unforeseen ways. As they each attempt to forge their own path through the ranks of fin de siècle bourgeois Swedish society, it becomes apparent that none of them can escape the family traits of egoism and a desire for money regardless of ethics.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In this bildungsroman with five subjects, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sigfrid-siwertz\">Siwertz</a> charts the societal and cultural changes he observed during his own adolescence and early adulthood in Stockholm and the surrounding areas. <i>Downstream</i> (titled in the Swedish original simply as <i>Selambs</i>) is perhaps his best known work from a broad corpus of novels, short stories, poems and plays, and has remained highly regarded. Siwertz himself became part of the Swedish literary establishment later in life, as a member of the Swedish Academy and the Nobel Prize for Literature committee.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This edition is based on the 1923 English translation by Macmillan of Canada.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>Martin Arrowsmith, the titular protagonist, grows up in a small Midwestern town where he wants to become a doctor. At medical school he meets an abrasive but brilliant professor, Gottlieb, who becomes his mentor. As Arrowsmith completes his training he begins a career practicing medicine. But, echoing <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sinclair-lewis\">Lewis’s</a> <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sinclair-lewis/main-street\">Main Street</a></i>, small-town life becomes too insular and restricting; his interest in research and not people makes him unpopular, and he decides to work in a research laboratory instead.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>From there Arrowsmith begins a career that hits all of the ethical quandaries that scientists and those in the medical profession encounter: everything from the ethical problem of research protocol strictness versus saving lives, to doing research for the betterment of mankind versus for turning a profit, to the politics of institutions, to the social problems of wealth and poverty. Arrowsmith struggles with these dilemmas because, like all of us, he isn’t perfect. Despite his interest in helping humanity, he has little interest in people—aside from his serial womanizing—and this makes the path of his career an even harder one to walk. He’s surrounded on all sides by icons of nobility, icons of pride, and icons of rapaciousness, each one distracting him from his calling.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though the book isn’t strictly a satire, few escape Lewis’s biting pen. He skewers everyone indiscriminately: small-town rubes, big-city blowhards, aspiring politicians, doctors of both the noble and greedy variety, hapless ivory-towered researchers, holier-than-thou neighbors, tedious gilded-age socialites, and even lazy and backwards islanders. In some ways, <i>Arrowsmith</i> rivals <i>Main Street</i> in its often-bleak view of human nature—though unlike <i>Main Street</i>, the good to humanity that science offers is an ultimate light at the end of the tunnel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel’s publication in 1925 made it one of the first serious “science” novels, exploring all aspects of the life and career of a modern scientist. Lewis was aided in the novel’s preparation by Paul de Kruif, a microbiologist and writer, whose medically-accurate contributions greatly enhance the text’s realist flavor.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In 1926 <i>Arrowsmith</i> was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, but Lewis famously declined it. In his refusal letter, he claimed a disinterest in prizes of any kind; but the <i>New York Times</i> reported that those close to him say he was still angered over the Pulitzer’s last-minute snatching of the 1921 prize from <i>Main Street</i> in favor of giving it to <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edith-wharton/the-age-of-innocence\">The Age of Innocence</a></i>.</p>\n\t\t",

E.</abbr> Lawrence’s</a> memoir of his involvement in leading a portion of the Arab revolt against the Ottoman empire during World War I. The empire had joined the side of Germany and the Central Powers in the war, and Britain hoped that a successful revolt would take the empire out of the war effort. Britain had also promised the Arabs that, if they were successful, England would recognize a single Arab state.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Lawrence convinced the Arab leaders, who had historically not shown a willingness to work together, to join forces in supporting Britain’s strategy in the area. His memoir is part travelogue, part philosophy treatise, and part action novel. It details his movements and actions during his two year involvement, his relationships with the various Arab leaders and men who fought with him, and his thoughts—and doubts—during that time. It’s a gripping tale made famous by the movie <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, and one that Winston Churchill called “unsurpassable” as a “narrative of war and adventure.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The manuscript of <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> has a rich history. Lawrence finished his first draft in 1919 from his notes during the war, but lost most of it when changing trains in England (it was never found). The next year, he started working on a new version from memory that ended up being sixty percent longer than the original. He then edited that version (although it was still a third longer than the original draft), finishing it in early 1922, and had eight copies of it printed to give to friends so they could review it and offer editing suggestions (and to prevent a repeat of losing his only copy). About this time he re-enlisted in the service, but friends convinced him to work on a version he could publish. In 1926, he had a first edition of approximately 200 copies published that included 125 black-and-white and color illustrations from sixteen different artists. The first edition lost money, and it was the only edition published during his lifetime. This edition uses the first edition text and includes all 125 of the original illustrations, including both endpapers.</p>\n\t\t",

At fifteen he gets a job and starts to ease out of their lives, eventually landing in some trouble that causes him to flee the town where they live. Two years later, Clyde meets his well-off uncle, who owns a large factory in upstate New York. Clyde talks his way into a job at the factory, and soon finds himself supervising a roomful of women. All alone, generally shunned by his uncle’s family, and starved for companionship, he breaks the factory’s rules and begins a relationship with a young woman who works for him. But Clyde has visions of marrying a high-society woman, and fortune smiles on him in the form of the daughter of one of his uncle’s neighbors. Soon Clyde finds himself in a love triangle of his own making, and one from which he seems incapable of extracting himself.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>A newspaperman before he became a novelist, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/theodore-dreiser\">Theodore Dreiser</a> collected crime stories for years of young men in relationships with young women of poorer means, where the young men found a richer, prettier girl who would go with him, and often took extreme measures to escape from the first girl. <i>An American Tragedy</i>, based on one of the most infamous of those real-life stories, is a study in lazy ambition, the very real class system in America, and how easy it is to drift into evil. It is populated with poor people who desire nothing more than to be rich, rich people whose only concern is to keep up with their neighbors and not be associated with the “wrong element,” and elements of both who care far more about appearances than reality. It offers further evidence that the world may be very different from 100 years ago, but the people in it are very much the same.</p>\n\t\t",

Living with her sister and brother-in-law, she quickly finds that life, and work, are hard in the big city. She soon takes up with a traveling salesman she met on the train into town. Months later her eye is turned by one of the salesman’s acquaintances, George Hurstwood, and vice-versa. A series of events lead Carrie and Hurstwood to New York City, where both struggle to live out the aspirations that brought them there.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/theodore-dreiser\">Theodore Dreiser</a> was one of the earliest naturalist writers, but he wrote <i>Sister Carrie</i> while the United States was still very Victorian in its morals. The book therefore caused a stir from the beginning: Carrie Meeber was clearly, even in the disguised language of the time, a sexually active, unmarried female, who wasn’t made to suffer for her indiscretion to the extent considered necessary at the time. Dreiser’s depiction of rough language merely added to the controversy. The first printing sold only 456 copies in two years; it was to be another five years before Dreiser could convince another publisher to carry the book. Today it’s considered a classic and one of the “greatest of all American urban novels.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The text of <i>Sister Carrie</i> was unchanged until 1981, when the University of Pennsylvania Press published a new version with 36,000 words restored. The edition was not without controversy: the cuts were originally made before the first printing at the suggestion of Dreiser’s wife, or his friend Arthur Henry, and Dreiser had approved all of them. Although the new Pennsylvania Edition, as it is called, made a good case for restoring the changes, it is the 1907 text that remains the most widely available today, and it is that text in this edition.</p>\n\t\t",

Before sailing from Tampa, they were forced to leave behind four of the twelve total companies and almost all of their horses. As an officer, Roosevelt kept his horse, which he rode to lead the charge in the Battle of San Juan Hill. Roosevelt recalled the battle as “the great day of my life” and “my crowded hour.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After winning the war, the onset of yellow fever, malaria, and other incapacitating diseases made it imperative to return the soldiers home quickly. Along with nine generals, Roosevelt drafted and signed a “round robin” letter, which was also published nationwide to turn public attention toward returning the troops. Back home, Roosevelt initially published the work serially in <i>Scribner’s Magazine</i> in 1899, and its popularity contributed to his rise as a national figure.</p>\n\t\t",

The bulk of the novel takes the form of the a commentary on the life and works of the fictional Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, a sort of renaissance-man German philosopher who develops a “Philosophy of Clothes.” The commentary is composed by a fictional English commentator, known only as the “Editor”; the Editor claims to have translated many of Teufelsdröckh’s ideas and quotes from German. As the commentary progresses, the Editor receives a bag of paper scraps on which are written various autobiographical fragments from Teufelsdröckh’s life. The Editor’s attempts to organize and interpret these scraps forms the second part of the novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The work is multi-faceted: sometimes a parody, sometimes a comedy, sometimes a satire, and sometimes seriously philosophical. Some critics consider it an early existentialist text. At the very least its unique structure and use of meta-narrative is hugely influential to modern literature; Borges was said to have memorized entire pages, and modern texts like Nabokov’s <i>Pale Fire</i> borrow liberally from the concept of a meta-narrative organized on scraps of paper.</p>\n\t\t",

At the time, its unconventional and somewhat scandalous themes earned it widespread criticism and condemnation. In the 1912 “Wessex Edition,” <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-hardy\">Hardy</a> appended a postscript to the book’s preface in which he stated that the outrage ultimately abated with no lingering effect other than “completely curing me of further interest in novel-writing.” Indeed, <i>Jude</i> was to be Hardy’s last novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The story chronicles the life of Jude Fawley, an orphan boy of unremarkable birth or means, growing up in the small farming village of Marygreen in Hardy’s fictional version of Wessex, England. From an early age, Jude determines to chart the course of his life by the stars of learning and scholarship, but he very quickly discovers just how little interest the society of his time would take in the grand ambitions of a young man of so humble an origin. Without proper guidance and limited resources, his progress is slow and arduous. And when he discovers the existence of his cousin, the charming Sue Bridehead, it is nearly abandoned altogether in favor of an almost obsessive pursuit.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel proceeds to trace the lives of Jude and Sue as they become locked in a struggle both against themselves and the conventions of their times. Lofty ideals clash with harsh realities; grand pursuits fall prey to darker aspects of human nature. Characters are complex: at times spiteful, selfish, or self-destructive. Hardy, however, remains very subtle in his portrayal of these tragic figures and their flaws. The effect is to render them convincingly human. Ultimately, <i>Jude</i> is an unhappy tale of unfulfilled promise that is rarely told, and rarely told so well.</p>\n\t\t",

When Tess participates in the village May Dance, she meets Angel, who stops to join the dance but notices Tess too late to dance with her. That night, Tess’s father gets too drunk to drive to the market, so she undertakes the journey herself. However, she falls asleep at the reins, and the family’s only horse encounters a speeding wagon and is fatally wounded. Tess feels so guilty over the consequences for the family that she agrees to try to claim kin with a rich widow who lives in a neighbouring town. The story traces Tess’s life through the following years.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel has been adapted for the stage, theatre, opera, cinema and television numerous times since its publication.</p>\n\t\t",

The French had added many of the elements familiar to modern readers, among them Lancelot, and the search for the Holy Grail. Malory combined, edited, and added some of his own material to the stories available to him, and in the process created a uniquely British work. (It was his printer Caxton who gave it a French name.) <i>Le Morte d’Arthur</i> is the source material for almost all modern retellings of King Arthur and his knights, from Hollywood movies and musicals to Nobel-prize winning writers.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Malory’s identity is still in some dispute, as there are several men of various spellings of the name to choose from. Sir Thomas Malory from Newbold Revel in Warwickshire is the most popular choice, but his life of crime—he was a rapist and serial thief at the minimum—seems to be at odds with the acts of chivalry and moral code present in this book. It is known from the author’s own notes that he wrote the book while in prison; perhaps he was trying to make amends for his crimes. Regardless, the result was to give new life to King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Age of Reason</i> is an important work in the American Deist movement. <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thomas-paine\">Paine</a> worked on it continually for more than a decade, publishing it in three parts from 1794 through 1807. It quickly became a best-seller in post-Revolution America, spurring a revival in Deism as an alternative to the prevailing Christian influence.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In clear, simple, and often funny language, Paine attempts to dissect the Bible’s supposed inaccuracies and hypocrisies. He portrays the Bible as a human construct, full of illogic, errors, and internal inconsistencies, as opposed to it being a text born of divine inspiration. On those arguments he pivots to decrying not just Christianity, but organized religion as a whole, as a human invention created to terrorize and enslave. Instead of accepting organized religion, he states that “his mind is his own church” and that man must embrace reason.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While these arguments weren’t new to the wealthy and educated class of the era, they <em>were</em> new to the poor masses. The book was at first distributed as cheap unbound pamphlets, making it easily accessible to the poor; and Paine’s simple language was written in way the poor could understand and sympathize with. This made the powerful very nervous, and, fearing that the book could cause a potential revolution, Paine and his publishers were suppressed.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Paine wrote <i>The Age of Reason</i> while living in Paris. In France, its thesis wasn’t revolutionary <em>enough</em> for the bloodthirsty Jacobins; he was imprisoned there for ten months and only escaped execution through a stroke of luck. Meanwhile in Britain, the government considered the pamphlets seditious. British booksellers and publishers involved in printing and distributing the pamphlets were repeatedly tried for seditious and blasphemous libel, with some even receiving sentences of hard labor.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Paine began writing Part III after escaping France for America, but even the American elite thought the book too scandalous, with Thomas Jefferson—himself a Deist—advising Paine not to publish. Paine listened to Jefferson’s advice and held off publishing Part III for five years before publishing extracts as separate pamphlets. For that reason, Part III is not a concrete publication, but rather an arrangement of several loosely-related pamphlets organized at the discretion of an edition’s editor.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Once it was in the hands of Americans, it sparked a revival in Deism in the United States before being viciously attacked from all sides. Paine earned a reputation as an agitator and blasphemer that stuck to him for the rest of his life.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Despite <i>The Age of Reason</i>’s harsh reception—or perhaps, <em>because</em> of it, and the controversy and discussion it caused—it achieved a popularity in England, France, and America that gave it incredible influence in those nation’s perspectives on organized religion.</p>\n\t\t",

Paine carefully dissects and counters Burke’s arguments and provides a more accurate description of the events surrounding the revolution of 1789. He then reproduces and comments on the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens” promulgated by the National Assembly of France.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The manuscript of <i>The Rights of Man</i> was placed with the publisher Joseph Johnson, but that publisher was threatened with legal action by the British Government. Paine then gave the work to another publisher, J. S.

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>American naturalist and conservationist <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thornton-w-burgess\">Thornton W. Burgess</a> was the author of more than one hundred books for children; the best-remembered of these is <i>Old Mother West Wind</i>, which was originally written for his young son. Burgess also wrote dozens of books about the creatures of the northern North American forest, four of which are collected here as the <i>Green Forest Stories</i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This <i>Green Forest Stories</i> compilation focuses on Lightfoot the Deer, Blacky the Crow, Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, and twin bear cubs Woof-Woof and Boxer. Readers may have encountered these characters in other of Burgess’s stories about the “little people” of the Massachusetts forest. Burgess’s earliest ventures into animal fantasy are roughly contemporary with <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rudyard-kipling\">Rudyard Kipling’s</a> <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/rudyard-kipling/just-so-stories\">Just So Stories</a></i> and Beatrix Potter’s tales of various animals, and represent the most lasting American entry into this genre.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Animal fantasy is a sub-genre of children’s literature in which animals are anthropomorphized into human-like characters and use language like humans. It is often criticized by those who want readers to experience more realistic representations of animals and the natural world, but animal fantasies engage a millennia-old tradition, in the Western canon reaching back at least as far as <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aesop\">Aesop’s</a> <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aesop/fables/v-s-vernon-jones\">Fables</a></i>; animal characters feature in teaching stories for children (and adults) in cultures around the world. Burgess’s stories are intended for children in the early elementary grades. The challenges and triumphs of the “little people” in his stories will feel identifiable to many young readers, and the snippets of moralizing and authorial commentary interleaved with the actions of the plot reflect a teaching device with a long history.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the late twentieth century, Burgess fell out of favour with teachers and librarians. This shift occurred in part due to changing tastes in literary style and in part due to a changing society. Burgess is entirely a writer of his time. Most of the animals he depicts are male, and many of the female animals who wander into the stories are more passive and more stereotyped than the kinds of representation preferred for girls today. (Such is not the case, however, of Old Granny Fox, who may be the smartest of the little people Burgess represents and certainly does not lack agency or self-determination.)</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The style of Burgess’s storytelling is undeniably old-fashioned but still deserves consideration. Although the writing is often simple and plain, there are rhetorical flourishes that reveal the author’s attention to craft. In particular, Burgess’s use of formulaic expressions such as “jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun” and “the Merry Little Breezes” links these tales to an orality that stretches back to at least <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-iliad/william-cullen-bryant\">The Iliad</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-odyssey/william-cullen-bryant\">The Odyssey</a></i> of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer\">Homer</a> (think of phrases such as “the wine-dark sea,” “rosy-fingered Dawn,” and “bright-eyed Athena”). Through his broader use of repetition and through onomatopoeia, Burgess underscores characteristics of his characters’ real-life forest counterparts—the way a chickadee calls, a squirrel scolds, or a rabbit lopes, for example.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In these stories, as in the <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thornton-w-burgess/green-meadow-stories\">Green Meadow Stories</a></i> collection, we observe features that signal Burgess’s experience as a writer for periodicals and as an early radio broadcaster. Each chapter begins with reminders about the previous chapter, and chapters end with either a strong, propulsive conclusion or a traditional cliff-hanger. The chapters are generally quite short—a comfortable size to read as a bedtime story, and just long enough to hold a new reader’s attention without demanding too much of that reader’s energy. The strong narrative voice sounds distinctly like oral storytelling. One can almost imagine a small group of young people seated in a circle at the storyteller’s feet.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>That image captures the essence of these animal tales. They are light, bright peeks into a complex and beautiful world, a world any girl or boy may want to pursue through study or personal explorations. As humanity faces the daily loss of animal species, stories that delight readers and listeners, that encourage them to learn about and respect the creatures of the non-human world, deserve our renewed attention and respect.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thornton-w-burgess\">Thornton W. Burgess</a> was an American naturalist and the author of dozens of books for children, the most enduring of which are <i>Old Mother West Wind</i> and <i>The Burgess Bird Book for Children</i>. Burgess was a passionate twentieth-century conservationist who dedicated his life to teaching children and their families about the importance of the natural life of the northern North American forest.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The <i>Green Meadow Stories</i> compilation is made up of four distinct but entwined tales: those of Happy Jack Squirrel, Mrs. Peter Rabbit, Bowser the Hound, and Old Granny Fox. Through the adventures of these focal characters readers are introduced to the wider territory of the Green Meadows, the Green Forest, and the Smiling Pond as well as to the animals’ Great World.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The animals of Burgess’s stories are anthropomorphized, undoubtedly, but not caricatured: these are not the twee creatures of Disney cartoons. Their behaviour is explained in ways that would be understandable to a human child—this is fiction, after all—but Burgess’s “little people of the forest” are not simply humans dressed in fur and feathers. The original illustrations in Burgess’s books (by Harrison Cady, not reproduced in this edition) show the animals wearing clothes, but Burgess’s own descriptions of animals are more natural and metaphorical, and less fantastic. For example, he describes Chatterer the Red Squirrel, “who always wears a red coat with vest of white,” a compact way of communicating the look of a squirrel that many of today’s children will never have seen with their own eyes. Less pleasantly, it is Peter Rabbit’s fur and flesh that is rent when Hooty the Owl tears Peter’s “coat” one night on the Old Pasture.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Burgess has tremendous respect for the creatures he depicts, as well as for their natural home. While the presentation of the Green Meadow is hardly “Nature, red in tooth and claw,” it is surprisingly unsentimental. Peter Rabbit, for example, lives a highly anxious life under threat from the many predators who would enjoy having him for dinner; similarly, Happy Jack Squirrel experiences days and nights of terror when Shadow the Weasel discovers Happy Jack’s home and hunts him relentlessly. During a long, hard winter, Granny Fox and Reddy Fox come close to starving, and Old Man Coyote leads Bowser the Hound on a dangerous chase that may result in one or the other dying. Despite other fanciful, sentimental elements of storytelling, Burgess does not sugarcoat prey/predator relationships or the precarity of wild animals’ lives.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Burgess is a clear conservationist in his representations of hunting. The animals are highly aware of hunters and their “dreadful guns.” It is a notable moment in this collection when Farmer Brown’s Boy decides he will no longer use his gun to harm the little people of the Green Meadow and the Green Forest. The stories are also notable in their detailed representation of a largely intact forest, something few children in the twenty-first century will experience.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>On the other hand, these are books for children, and they contain plenty of sweetness and light. Animal pairings—such as when Peter Rabbit meets the dainty Little Miss Fuzzytail, the future Mrs. Rabbit—are vague but sentimental and soon lead to proud new families of Rabbits, Ducks, Deer, and Owls. The “little people” celebrate the arrival of each spring’s babies, mark each other’s new relationships and homes, play together, and even help each other survive. They laugh, tease, and trick each other—a fanciful interpretation of animal behaviour that could lead to a reader’s life-long fascination with, and respect for, forest creatures—and for generations of readers, they did just that.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The stories are also more didactic than most twenty-first-century authors would dare to be. There are morals associated with most stories, often attributed to the animal about whom the story is being told. Through this practical teaching, Burgess suggests a correspondence between how animals and humans live; but he consistently clarifies that animal intelligence is different from, but certainly no less than, human intelligence.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Unlike the bouncy rhyming verses of many of today’s children’s books, Burgess’s sentences have a somewhat old-fashioned cadence, creating the distinct and appealing music of traditional storytelling. Burgess’s episodic chapters are eminently readable and particularly come to life when they are voiced by animated reading-aloud. For older readers looking for something different to share with children, or for new readers beginning to tackle “chapter books,” the tales of the <i>Green Meadow Stories</i> collection are a delightful place to discover Burgess and his animal friends.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>1899 was the tail end of the Gilded Age, a time in America of rapid economic expansion that caused a select few to become ultra-wealthy, while millions of commoners struggled in abject poverty. It was against this backdrop that <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/thorstein-veblen\">Veblen</a>, an economist and sociologist at the University of Chicago, wrote <i>The Theory of the Leisure Class</i>, a book that brought the phrase “conspicuous consumption” into the modern vocabulary.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Veblen’s thesis centers on the definition of what he calls the “leisure class,” the upper social class consisting of wealthy individuals who are socially exempt from productive work. Their work instead becomes what he calls “conspicuous consumption”: spending their wealth in increasingly ostentatious ways in order to preserve their class status. Meanwhile, the lower and middle classes are the ones actually engaged in work that is productive to society—manufacturing and industry—with the goal of eventually being able to emulate the social status afforded by the conspicuous consumption of their leisure class masters.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Along the way, Veblen links these behaviors with social strictures left over from feudal society, arguing that contemporary human society has not evolved far beyond our medieval peasant-and-lord forefathers. In those ancient societies, productive labor came to be viewed as disreputable and dirty; thus, status is won not by accumulating wealth, but by displaying the evidence of wealth. He argues that many of what some would consider society’s ills are linked to this fundamental concept: for example, the mistreatment of women—forcing them into constricting clothing, preventing them from participating in independent economic life—is a way for their husbands to show off their unemployed status as a kind of conspicuous leisure; or society’s obsession with sports, celebrity, and organized religion, all forms of conspicuous leisure that bring no productive benefit to society, and on the contrary waste time and resources, but whose practitioners—superstars and clergy—maintain a high social status.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though it was written over a hundred years ago when industrial society was just getting its footing, Veblen’s thesis predicts much of the social stratification we recognize today. Practical labor continues to be viewed as basically demeaning, while people struggle in vain to chase a glimmer of the vast wealth that celebrities, investors, bankers, hedge fund managers, and C-suite dwellers—the conspicuously-consuming leisure class of today—openly flaunt. As such, <i>The Theory of the Leisure Class</i> might be one of the most prescient and influential books of economic and social science of the 20th century.</p>\n\t\t",

The play opened in London in 1858 but quickly made its way to the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> and premiered at Laura Keene’s Theatre in New York City later that year. It remained popular in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> and England for the next several decades. Its most notable claim to fame, however, is that it was the play <abbr>U.S.</abbr> President Abraham Lincoln was watching on April 14, 1865 when he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, who used his knowledge of the script to shoot Lincoln during a more raucous scene.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play is a classic Victorian farce with a whole range of stereotyped characters, business, and many entrances and exits. The plot features a boorish but honest American cousin who travels to the aristocratic English countryside to claim his inheritance, and then quickly becomes swept up in the family’s affairs. An inevitable rescue of the family’s fortunes and of the various damsels in distress ensues.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Our American Cousin</i> was originally written as a farce for an English audience, with the laughs coming mostly at the expense of the naive American character. But after it moved to the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> it was eventually recast as a comedy where English caricatures like the pompous Lord Dundreary soon became the primary source of hilarity. This early version, published in 1869, contains fewer of that character’s nonsensical adages, which soon came to be known as “Dundrearyisms,” and for which the play eventually gained much of its popular appeal.</p>\n\t\t",

In them Grant, the most able General of the Civil War, tells the story of his life and experiences, covering his birth, early youth, military training at West Point, his involvement as a Lieutenant in the Mexican War of 1847–48, and of course, his role in the Civil War of 1861–65, during which he rose to become the supreme commander of the Northern forces. After the Mexican War, Grant had left military service and became, essentially, an unsuccessful shopkeeper. Re-enlisting at the start of the Civil War, he rose to his ultimate position entirely on his own merits, showing himself to be a skilled strategist and a master of logistics.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>What distinguishes Grant’s <i>Personal Memoirs</i>, and makes them a clear candidate for being considered a part of American literature, is the high quality and interest of the writing, for which Grant clearly had a talent. Though he goes into an extremely high level of detail about the military movements and struggles of the Civil War, the book is full of interest, and in parts is as gripping as a novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Obviously, Grant tells only his own part of the story and from the perspective of the ultimately successful forces; but his humanity shows through in the respect he offers to those on the other side, and in his acknowledgement of their sufferings, despite his clear condemnation of their cause of preserving slavery. He is generous in awarding due credit to others on his own side, and where blame is due tempering it with his understanding of that person’s character, background and circumstances.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After the war, Grant served two terms as President of the United States between 1869–77, but his <i>Memoirs</i> do not deal with this period. He began writing the book on his retirement, and completed it only after suffering from severe illness and not long before his death from throat cancer. The first edition was published in two volumes by Mark Twain in 1885.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition includes 43 maps reproduced from the 1895 edition of the <i>Memoirs</i>.</p>\n\t\t",

The first two volumes were published in French in March 1862 and translated into English later the same year. Since then it has been translated by numerous others and has been adapted for film, television, radio, animation and the stage.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This epic novel tells the story of Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who is attempting to escape from his past. Newly released from the galley-ships, Jean Valjean steals the silverware from the bishop who has taken him in for the night. When he is captured, the bishop urges him to use the silver to become an honest citizen. Valjean becomes a wealthy man, owner of a factory and mayor of his town but his past is only a footstep away in the form of Javert, Inspector of Police, who recognises Valjean from his time as a guard.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>A factory-worker, who has been dismissed from Valjean’s employment, is sentenced to six months imprisonment but ends up dying in the town’s hospital and Valjean feels responsible for the downward spiral of her life, so rescues her child, Cosette, from the corrupt inn-keepers with whom her mother had left her.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The rest of the novel tells the stories of Valjean, Cosette and other characters which intertwine with each other. Hugo also included a number of “digressions” on subjects including cloistered religious orders, the use of slang language and, most significantly, the battle of Waterloo.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The book was highly anticipated in 1862, having been advertised from as early as 1860. Hugo did not allow the publishers to summarise the story in advance, surely because any summary could not do a novel of this length any justice.</p>\n\t\t",

By centering on the building, he was able to bring all classes into his story: from kings and nobles to bellringers and sewer rats.

On the surface, it follows Clarissa Dalloway, an Englishwoman in her fifties, minute by minute through the June day on which she is having a party. At a deeper level, however, the novel demonstrates, through an effortless stream of consciousness, the connections formed in human interaction—whether these interactions are fleeting, or persist through decades.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This is a novel to read and cherish, if only to marvel at Woolf’s linguistic acrobatics. Words and phrases swoop and soar like swallows. Woolf’s sentences are magnificent: sinuous, whirling, impeccably detailed. As narrative perspective shifts from character to character—sometimes within a single sentence—readers come to understand the oh-so-permeable barrier between self and other. Through Clarissa we meet Septimus Warren Smith, his wife Rezia, and a cast of dozens more, all connected by the “leaden circles” of Big Ben marking the passage of every hour, by the pavements of Bloomsbury that lead everywhere and nowhere. Modernist London has never been portrayed more sublimely: replete with birdsong and flowers, resplendent in sunshine, youthful yet eternal—and even in the aftermath of war and pandemic, resilient.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> is Woolf’s attempt to express that which may be inexpressible. It offers a close examination of how difficult it is, even when our hearts are brimming, to say what we really feel; and it examines the damage we inflict through our reticence with words, our withholding of love. It is a novel of the soul, and a work of immense beauty.</p>\n\t\t",

An ocean cruise with her father leaves her for the summer at her Aunt’s villa in an unnamed South American country, where she meets the English inhabitants of the local town’s hotel. As the season progresses she starts to become entangled in their own lives and passions, and through those burgeoning acquaintances and friendships the discovery of her own nature grows.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Voyage Out</i> is <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virginia-woolf\">Virginia Woolf’s</a> first novel and was a labour of love, taking her five years to complete. Even though heavy editing was required to reduce some of the more politically charged themes before its publication in 1915, it still bemused some contemporary critics and even garnered accusations of “reckless femininity.” Time however has proved kinder, with the book demonstrating the key points of Woolf’s future style. It even has the first appearance of Clarissa Dalloway, the titular protagonist of Woolf’s later and more famous novel <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virginia-woolf/mrs-dalloway\"><i><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Dalloway</i></a>.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>Set on an island off the Scottish coast, <i>To the Lighthouse</i> minutely examines the fleeting impressions of a large cast of family, friends, lovers, and hangers-on. Who can we be, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/virginia-woolf\">Virginia Woolf</a> invites us to ask, if no one can ever know our hearts—if they’re unknowable even to ourselves? <i>To the Lighthouse</i> remains one of the most important Modernist novels, exquisitely composed by one of the most gifted writers of the Modernist movement.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The opening section follows the passage of a day with a thwarted objective: to go to the nearby lighthouse. The concluding section revisits this expedition a decade later, when so much is irrevocably changed, as a chance to glimpse interpersonal understandings and connections. The novel provides a brilliant example of stream-of-consciousness writing, and raises questions that provoke us still: questions about whether children are the fullest realization of one’s posterity, how women artists are regarded socially, and how money and status enable—or close off—networks, relationships, and the dreams we hold most dear.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As masterful as its technique is, however, the lasting value of this novel for twenty-first-century readers may be its sharp representation of the emotional labor that people—particularly women—perform in order to manage the needs and expectations of others. Woolf wrote in an age when women’s participation in society was tightly restricted by class norms and stultifying domesticity. Nearly a century later, scholars still have a great deal to say about Mrs. Ramsay, Lily Briscoe, and the tension between Mr. Ramsay and his son James.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Woolf’s fifth novel, and one of her most successful books both critically and commercially, <i>To the Lighthouse</i> was originally published in 1927, simultaneously in England and the United States. Due to a quirk in the management and correction of the proofs, according to scholar Hans Walter Gabler, the two editions were “not identical, since in a significant number of instances Virginia Woolf marked up the first proofs differently” for her two publishers. The Standard Ebooks edition is based primarily on the Hogarth UK edition.</p>\n\t\t",

Later, she became a member of the American anarchist movement after becoming outraged at the way defendants were sentenced at the 1886 Haymarket Affair trials. Influences on de Cleyre’s beliefs and writings included <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mary-wollstonecraft\">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> and her lover and fellow anarchist Dyer Lum. She also shared a respectful disagreement with her fellow feminist anarchist <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/emma-goldman\">Emma Goldman</a>, who eventually came to praise her as “the most gifted and brilliant anarchist woman America ever produced.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Prominent themes in de Cleyre’s poetry include the Haymarket Affair and its aftermath (e.g. “At the Grave in Waldheim”), anti-clericalism (e.g. “The Gods and the People”) and women’s liberation (e.g. “Betrayed”). While largely ignored during most of the 20th century, interest in de Cleyre and her poetry has revived during the late 20th century, thanks in part to Paul Avrich’s 1978 biography, <i>An American Anarchist: The Life of Voltairine de Cleyre</i>.</p>\n\t\t",

B Du Bois’s</a> <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i> represented a seismic shift in the discussion of race in the United States. Earlier African-American authors had broken ground with memoirs and autobiographical novels—narrative works that portrayed the African-American experience through the stories of particular individuals. What Du Bois envisioned was a work that portrayed the experience of African Americans <em>as a people</em>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As a professor of sociology, Du Bois naturally gravitated toward a scientific and scholarly approach. But he was also becoming, to his own surprise, a political activist, and found himself increasingly disenchanted with purely intellectual arguments when his fellow African Americans were being lynched, starved, and driven from their land. What emerged from this tension between scholarly rigor and righteous indignation was a book that became a seminal text for both sociology and for the civil rights movement.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The fourteen essays in this book weave together historical research, sociological analysis, first-hand reportage, political argument, and an enduring, aspirational belief in the possibility of America. Many of the ideas that Du Bois introduced in the book have become mainstays of modern discourse, including the “veil of race” and the concept of double consciousness. These insights, originally rooted in race, have proven resonant to a wide range of other marginalized groups and have provided a useful framework for understanding the nature of oppression and the path to liberation.</p>\n\t\t",

Its 58 short vignettes are based on <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/w-somerset-maugham\">Maugham’s</a> travels along the Yangtze River from 1919 to 1920. Although later editions of the book added the subtitle “Sketches of Life in China,” there are actually only a few descriptions of the places he visited and the local Chinese people he met; rather, Maugham focuses on relaying his encounters with a range of Europeans living and working in the country. Maugham is quite critical of many of them and their lack of interest in, and sometimes disdain, for the country and its people, except for the extent to which their careers and pockets could benefit. His sketches highlight the difficulties that many expatriates encounter while living in a foreign culture.</p>\n\t\t",

First published in 1919 in the United Kingdom by Heinemann, the story is inspired by the life of the French artist Paul Gauguin. It’s told in episodic form from a first-person perspective. The narrator, who came to know Strickland through his wife’s literary parties, begins the story as Strickland leaves for Paris. Strickland’s new life becomes a stark contrast to his life in London. While he was once a well-off banker living a comfortable life, he must now sleep in cheap hotels while suffering both illness and hunger.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/w-somerset-maugham\">Maugham</a> spent a year in Paris in 1904, which is when he first heard the story of Gauguin, the banker who left his family and profession to pursue his passion for art. He heard the story from others who had known and worked with Gauguin. Ten years later Maugham travelled to Tahiti where he met others who had known Gauguin during the artist’s time there. Inspired by the stories he heard, Maugham wrote <i>The Moon and Sixpence</i>. Although based on the life of Paul Gauguin, the story is a work of fiction.</p>\n\t\t",

The protagonist, who we know simply as “M.” or “Midgetina,” is a young woman just a few inches in height—though at times it seems that her height varies. Sometimes she’s small enough to be accosted by birds and carried on trays, and at other times it seems she’s large enough to ride horseback and even pass as a ten-year-old. She trips over hairbrushes, reads books that are larger than her, and must be especially careful around dogs and cats. The people around her seem to take this bizarre state of affairs in stride, and indeed, it’s the only truly uncanny quirk in an otherwise ornate, almost <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/henry-james\">Jamesian</a> narrative.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The narrative follows Midgetina as she struggles to make her way in life after the tragic death of her parents. Even though she’s minuscule in size, she’s extremely sharp intellectually, taking an interest in literature, astronomy, natural science, and more. Her personality is so distinct that her minuscule stature becomes more of a symbol of her isolation, than the actual cause of it.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In time she moves in to rooms managed by a Dickensian landlady, whose peripatetic daughter, Fanny, becomes a friend to Midgetina, a possible love interest, and even a sometimes-antagonist. Fanny, a master of manipulation, seems to float through life gleefully and selfishly using those around her. Midgetina, desperate for human connection, clings to Fanny with an interest that at times has an almost erotic edge. Fanny’s subtle manipulations, careless cruelty, and effortless charm make her a character just as memorable as Midgetina, and a powerful antidote to Midgetina’s naive, yearning hopefulness.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though largely forgotten today, <i>Memoirs of a Midget</i> was met with high praise from contemporary critics and went on to win the prestigious <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/collections/james-tait-black-memorial-fiction-prize-winners\">James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction</a>. Modern critic Edward Wagenknecht regards it as “the greatest English novel of its time.”</p>\n\t\t",

Like many of his other novels it has a complex plot and tackles social issues, in this case the then-lax state of the marriage laws, particularly in Scotland and Ireland. As always, Collins deals carefully but frankly with human personal behavior. To avoid offending Victorian morals too greatly, much is implied rather than stated outright. Nevertheless, even dealing with such matters at all led to his novels being derided as “sensation fiction” by his critics. By today’s standards, of course, they wouldn’t even raise an eyebrow.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In <i>Man and Wife</i>, the main character Anne Silvester has fallen pregnant to a muscular and handsome, but boorish man, Geoffrey Delamayn, to whom she is not married. She is working as a governess at a house in Scotland. Anne arranges to meet Delamayn secretly at a garden party and angrily demands that he fulfill his promise to marry her, that very day. He very reluctantly agrees to a secret, private marriage, knowing that a public marriage would badly affect his inheritance prospects. How is the marriage to be arranged quickly but kept quiet? Anne has a plan based on her understanding of the looseness of the marriage laws in Scotland. Naturally, of course, things go badly wrong with this plan and many complexities arise.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Collins is deeply critical of the state of contemporary marriage laws, both in how loosely they were framed, and in how little power over their own lives they gave to women once they were married, even if married to a brutal man. He also uses this novel to denounce the worship of sporting heroes and the obsession with physical prowess rather than mental superiority as a primary indication of male virtue.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though not as popular as his novels <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-woman-in-white\"><i>The Woman in White</i></a> and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone\"><i>The Moonstone</i></a>, <i>Man and Wife</i> received a good critical reception when it was released and was a commercial success.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>No Name</i> is set in England during the 1840s. It follows the fortunes of two sisters, Magdalen Vanstone and her older sister Norah. Their comfortable upper-middle-class lives are shockingly disrupted when, after the sudden deaths of their parents, they discover that they are disinherited and left without either name or fortune. The headstrong Magdalen vows to recover their inheritance, by fair means or foul. Her increasing desperation makes her vulnerable to a wily confidence trickster, Captain Wragge, who promises to assist her in return for a cut of the profits.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>No Name</i> was published in serial form like many of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins\">Wilkie Collins’</a> other works. They were tremendously popular in their time, with long queues forming awaiting the publication of each episode.

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Dead Secret</i> is <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins\">Wilkie Collins’</a> fourth novel. It first appeared in serial form in <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens\">Charles Dickens’</a> <i>Household Words</i> magazine during 1856. Like many of Collins’ books, it features incidents and themes which were considered to be sensational at the time; in this case, sex before marriage, illegitimacy, and fraud.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel opens with a scene at Porthgenna Tower, a mansion in Cornwall, where the lady of the house, Mrs. Treverton, is dying. On her deathbed, she tries to force her maidservant, Sarah Leeson, to swear that she will give a letter Mrs. Treverton has written to her husband, Captain Treverton, once she is dead. The letter reveals an important family secret in which Sarah is deeply involved and which she consequently is desperately unwilling to pass on. Mrs. Treverton succeeds in making Sarah swear not to destroy the letter or remove it from the house, but dies before making the young woman swear to give the letter to the Captain. Sarah therefore finds a place to conceal it within the house.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The rest of the novel deals with Rosamond, the Treverton’s daughter, who grows to adulthood and marries Leonard Franklin, a young man of a well-to-do family, who is afflicted with blindness. Franklin purchases Porthgenna Tower after the Captain’s death, and the couple plan to move into the property and renovate it. Doing so, however, means that they are likely to uncover the hidden letter concealing the family secret.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While critics don’t consider <i>The Dead Secret</i> to be one of Collins’ best novels, it contains some of the same elements of mystery and suspense as <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-woman-in-white\">The Woman in White</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins/the-moonstone\">The Moonstone</a></i>, and much of his characteristic wry humor.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>The “Moonstone” of the title is a large but flawed diamond, looted from India at the time of the Mutiny by an unscrupulous British officer. Many years later, estranged from his family due to his licentious lifestyle, the officer bequeaths the diamond to his sister’s daughter, Rachel Verrinder, to be given to her on her 18th birthday. Due to the ill-omens surrounding the gem, this may have been an act of revenge rather than reconciliation. The diamond, it appears, was taken from a statue of the Moon God worshipped by a Hindu cult, and it has long been sought by a group of Brahmins determined to return it to their temple.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>On the night of the birthday party the gem mysteriously disappears from Rachel’s room. While the first suspicions naturally fall on these Indians, they are eventually exculpated. Rachel becomes hysterical and angry when questioned about the theft and refuses to assist the police. Active efforts to assist them are taken up by Rachel’s cousin (and sweetheart) Franklin Blake. These efforts simply drive Rachel into further fury, and she becomes completely estranged from him. Suspicion thus falls on her as having some secret reason for wishing to raise money on the diamond. The novel proceeds to slowly uncover the mysteries involved.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Published in 1868, <i>The Moonstone</i> is often considered as one of the precursors of the modern detective novel, though this is a label which would not have been used by its author <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins\">Wilkie Collins</a> and his contemporaries. While it is true that the plot revolves around the mystery of a theft, and that it features Sergeant Cuff “in the Detective Force of Scotland Yard,” the novel is much more about character and relationships than the mere revelation of secrets. It also has a good dose of Collins’ humour, as the story is told in large part by eccentric characters such as the old house-steward Gabriel Betteredge who regards <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/daniel-defoe/the-life-and-adventures-of-robinson-crusoe\"><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></a> as an oracle; and the ultra-religious Miss Clack, determined to convert everyone to her views.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Immensely popular at the time of its publication in serial form, <i>The Moonstone</i> is rightly considered to be one of Collins’ best works, and remains highly regarded today.</p>\n\t\t",

The terms of her marriage settlement prevent Glyde accessing her money while she lives, so together with his deceptively charming and cunning friend, Count Fosco, they hatch an unscrupulous deception to do so nonetheless.

They have been sent to reawaken and spread the Roman Catholic faith in an area where it has grown weak: New Mexico, recently annexed by the United States. Desolate and remote, the territory is home to many diverse groups: Mexicans, including those on ranches established for hundreds of years; Indians, who have been there much longer and who are divided by language and customs into thirty nations; and newcomers—hunters, fur trappers, and those seeking gold. This book is as much their story as it is the story of the priests and the vast changes the land itself underwent in those years.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Death Comes for the Archbishop</i> was a departure for <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/willa-cather\">Willa Cather</a>, who had already published eight novels before publishing this one in 1927.

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Song of the Lark</i>, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/willa-cather\">Willa Cather’s</a> third novel, was written in 1915. It is said to have been inspired by the real-life soprano Olive Fremstad, a celebrated Swedish-American singer who, like the protagonist, was active in New York and Europe during the time period depicted in the novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The work explores how an artist’s early life influences their work. In the novel, Thea Kronborg discovers her talent as a singer, and goes on to achieve great fame and success once she leaves her tiny village of Moonstone. Cather eschewed depicting rural life as being idyllic, instead focusing on the conservative, restricted, patriarchal structures that its inhabitants live by. Her work is thus considered to be one of the earliest so-called “Revolt Novels.” She depicts a time at the end of the 19th century when the American West was expanding rapidly and Americans were gaining sophistication in their understanding of culture and artists, particularly compared to Europe. The title of the novel comes from the name of a 1884 painting by Jules Breton, which is described and considered in the book itself.</p>\n\t\t",

European culture at the time was delighting in Orientalism, and Beckford capitalized on this by merging a fashionable Gothic narrative with a lush Orientalist setting. The novel’s emphasis on the supernatural and on the horror of ghosts, ghouls, efreets, and djinns, was something still new to many contemporary readers; and couching a familiar morality tale in the trappings of an exotic setting made the story both accessible and fresh, contributing greatly to its popularity.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The story went on to inspire Romantic writers, including Lord Byron, Southey, Moore, and <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-keats\">Keats</a>; <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe\">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft\">H.

Williams is recognized as one of the foremost poets of American Modernism. In these collections a reader may perceive Williams’ contact with and subsequent growth through and away from Imagism. The poet’s work asserts a decidedly American approach to Modernism and features highly localized diction and imagery.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>William Carlos Williams was born in 1883, grew up in New Jersey, and was educated in Europe and the United States. He was friends with Hilda Doolittle “<abbr>H. D.</abbr>” and Ezra Pound, and through these friendships was introduced to Imagism. He eventually broke with the Imagists and invested himself instead in capturing the unique diction and linguistic intermingling of the United States, while remaining committed to the concreteness that characterizes Imagism. A practising doctor, Williams included many images of bodies, sickness, and medical care in his early poems. Williams later claimed there are “no ideas but in things,” a sentiment rooted in both his contact with Imagism and his firm sense of place.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Williams continued to read and respond to expatriate and English Modernism, culminating in his long work <i>Paterson</i>. In his later career Williams influenced postwar literary movements, most notably the Beat Generation. He died in 1963.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-congreve\">William Congreve’s</a> comedy <i>The Way of the World</i> was first performed in 1700 at the theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London. It was not well received, and as a result Congreve vowed never to write for the stage again—a vow he kept. Nonetheless the comedy was printed in the same year and has come to be regarded as the author’s masterpiece, a classic of Restoration drama.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In a world still reacting against the puritanism of Cromwell and the Commonwealth, Restoration drama had slowly transitioned from celebrating the licentiousness and opulence of the newly returned court to the more thoughtful and refined comedy of manners that was to dominate the English stage of 18th century. In one way Congreve’s <i>The Way of the World</i> is the last (and best) of its type, and in another way, it is the forerunner of a style that is echoed even now.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play centers on the love affair of Mirabell and Millamant who are prevented from marrying by a number of obstacles, not the least of which is Mirabell’s past dalliance with Millamant’s aunt’s affections. Intricate, witty, and amusing, the comedy nevertheless concludes with no clear heroes or heroines—one of the things that makes it such an incisive portrait of human experience and an enduring example of its type.</p>\n\t\t",

Pony Express rider, stagecoach driver, trapper, soldier, bison hunter, scout, showman—his résumé reads like the quintessential record of all that makes up the Old West mythology, and it’s all documented in this, his original 1879 autobiography.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>While <i>The Life of Buffalo Bill</i> is rife with the dramatic stylings of the dime novels and stage melodramas so popular at the time, in it Cody presents his version of his life: from his boyhood settling in the newly-opened Kansas territory, to his early life as a frontiersman. It was written when Cody was only thirty-three years old, just after he started his career as a showman and a few years before he created his world famous Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show. Originally titled <i>The Life of Hon. William F. Cody Known as Buffalo Bill the Famous Hunter, Scout, and Guide: An Autobiography</i>, it is an arguably more accurate account of both his life and the American West than the later 1917 autobiography <i>The Great West That Was: “Buffalo Bill’s” Life Story</i> which was ghostwritten by James Montague and published after his death. Although it makes many claims that are disputed today, <i>The Life of Buffalo Bill</i> reveals much about both the historical William F. Cody and the Buffalo Bill of American legend, and gives insight into the history of the American West.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>Soldiers’ Pay</i> is <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-faulkner\">William Faulkner’s</a> first published novel. It begins with a train journey on which two American soldiers, Joe Gilligan and Julian Lowe, are returning from the First World War. They meet a scarred, lethargic, and withdrawn fighter pilot, Donald Mahon, who was presumed dead by his family. The novel continues to focus on Mahon and his slow deterioration, and the various romantic complications that arise upon his return home.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Faulkner drew inspiration for this novel from his own experience of the First World War. In the spring of 1918, he moved from his hometown, Oxford, Mississippi, to Yale and worked as an accountant until meeting a Canadian Royal Air Force pilot who encouraged him to join the R.A.F. He then traveled to Toronto, pretended to be British (he affected a British accent and forged letters from British officers and a made-up Reverend), and joined the R.A.F. in the hopes of becoming a hero. But the war ended before he was able to complete his flight training, and, like Julian Lowe, he never witnessed actual combat. Upon returning to Mississippi, he began fabricating various heroic stories about his time in the air force (like narrowly surviving a plane crash with broken legs and metal plates under the skin), and proudly strode around Oxford in his uniform.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Faulkner was encouraged to write <i>Soldiers’ Pay</i> by his close friend and fellow writer <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sherwood-anderson\">Sherwood Anderson</a>, whom Faulkner met in New Orleans. Anderson wrote in his <i>Memoirs</i> that he went “personally to Horace Liveright”—<i>Soldiers’ Pay</i> was originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright—“to plead for the book.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though the novel was a commercial failure at the time of its publication, Faulkner’s subsequent fame has ensured its long-term success.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Night Land</i> is science fiction ahead of its time. Published in 1912, the book introduces a 17th-century gentleman who loses his wife. He soon discovers himself somehow reanimated in Earth’s far future, millions of years from now, when the sun has died and the Earth has become a hellish waste. What remains of humanity lives in titanic mile-high pyramids surrounded by energy shields to protect them from the abhuman monsters lurking in the darkness.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The human survivors soon receive a distress signal sent by a long-forgotten lesser pyramid, and the narrator embarks on a bloody quest to rescue the maiden of the pyramid—which he knows to be his lost love, somehow transcending time and space. On his journey the narrator is beset by countless horrifying monsters, many of them mutated former-humans. These depictions are so singular that <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-p-lovecraft\"><abbr>H. P.</abbr> Lovecraft</a> called <i>The Night Land</i> “one of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The novel is unique in its farsighted depiction of technology. The narrator has telepathic powers and is able to communicate with others over long distances. These powers are enabled by his “brain elements,” which are possibly surgically-implanted. Telepathic communications may be spied upon by the monsters of the waste, but a “master word” sent by the caller may verify the integrity of the signal—a description of a kind of early public-key cryptography.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The narrator survives on food pellets and “powdered water,” predicting a kind of astronaut food. His weapon of choice is a Diskos, a kind of whirling razor-sharp blade that shoots fire and energy. The machines and force fields of the human pyramid monument are powered by “Earth current,” which the narrator worries is slowly becoming dimmer over the years. The pyramid itself is a jewel of imagination: described as miles wide and miles high, each layer is its own city, and it continues deep underground where artificial grow chambers provide food for millions of humans.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Though the novel maintains a sort of legendary status for its grim and imaginative depiction of a monstrous future world, critics acknowledge the work as a flawed masterpiece. The narrative is written in a highly affected style, perhaps meant to emulate 17th century speech, or perhaps meant to be a stylized form of speech used by far-future humans. In any case, it resembles no <em>real</em> style of English, past or present. While some critics praise this style as uniquely atmospheric, others point to it, along with the lack of dialog or proper names, as some of the book’s more difficult aspects. Critics also frequently cite the book’s highly repetitious nature, simplistic characterization, and inordinate length—nearly 200,000 words—as major flaws. But despite whatever flaws the novel may have, the awesome vision of <i>The Night Land</i> remains a marvel to behold.</p>\n\t\t",

First serialized over the course of 19 volumes in <i>Punch Magazine</i> and first printed as a single volume in 1849, the novel cemented Thackeray’s literary fame and kept him busy with frequent revisions and even lecture circuits.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The story is framed as a puppet play, narrated by an unreliable narrator, that presents the story of Becky Sharp and Emmy Sedley and the people in their lives as they struggle through the Napoleonic Wars. The story itself, like many other Thackeray novels, is a satire of the lives of the Victorian English of a certain class. Thackeray packed the novel with allusions, many of which were difficult even for his contemporary readers; part of the heavy revisions he later made were making the allusions more accessible to his evolving audience.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>As part of his satirical bent, Thackeray made a point to make each character flawed, so that there are no “heroes” in the book—hence the subtitle “A Novel Without a Hero.” Thackeray’s goal was not only to entertain, but to instruct; to that end, he wanted the reader to look within themselves after finishing the unhappy conclusion, in which there’s no hint as to how society might be able to improve on the evils shadowed in the events of novel.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Vanity Fair</i> received glowing praise by its critical contemporaries, and remains a popular book well into modern times, having been adapted repeatedly for film, radio, and television.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Water of the Wondrous Isles</i> is a landmark in fantasy fiction. First published a year after <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-morris\">Morris’s</a> death in 1897 by Kelmscott Press—Morris’s own printing company—the novel follows Birdalone, a young girl who is stolen as a baby by a witch who takes her to serve in the woods of Evilshaw.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After she encounters a wood fairy that helps her escape the witch’s clutches, Birdalone embarks on a series of adventures across the titular Wondrous Isles. These isles are used by Morris both as parables for contemporary Britain and as vehicles for investigating his radical socialist beliefs. As Birdalone travels through the isles she slowly evolves into the embodiment of the Victorian “new woman,” embracing hard physical labor, healthy exercise, higher education, socialist values, and financial freedom, while rejecting sexual exploitation, physical abuse of both women and children, and the restrictive sexual mores of the era. This makes her unique in the fantasy fiction of the era as one of the genre’s first examples of a strong female hero.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This socialist-feminist allegory is presented in an Arthurian-style fantasy world complete with magic, witches, fairies, knights both chivalrous and evil, and castles (indeed, anyone doubting the allegorical nature of the work only needs to look at the name of the tale’s main redoubt: “The Castle of the Quest”). The language is purposefully archaic, reveling in vocabulary drawn from the language’s Anglo roots; and the prose is lent a hypnotic quality by its lack of quotation marks to offset dialog, and its short chapters characterized by a fairy-tale-narrative voice.</p>\n\t\t",

Its publisher, Cuthbert Burby, published it without listing an author, and any records that might have shed light on the author’s name (or names) were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. In the 1760s, the acclaimed scholar Edward Capell was one of the first to claim that <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-shakespeare\">William Shakespeare</a> might have been the author.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Many other academicians support this claim, or at least suggest Shakespeare partially wrote it, as certain archaic or obscure words and phrases found in the canonical Shakespearean plays also appear in this one. Others argue that Shakespeare would never write something so historically inaccurate; suggestions of possible alternative playwrights include Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe, Michael Drayton, Thomas Nashe, and George Peele. While the legitimate authorship may never come to light, <i>Edward III</i> has become accepted as part of Shakespeare’s canon of plays.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After the King of France passes away, a new heir must take the throne; without any brothers or sons in the direct line, the crown falls to his nephew, King Edward of England. French nobles refuse to hand over France to the English, claiming that the right of succession should never have passed through his mother Isabel, and order Edward to acknowledge King John as the rightful successor. These disputed claims to the kingdom of France launch the Hundred Years’ War.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on G. C. Moore Smith’s 1897 edition.</p>\n\t\t",

The play starts with Henry’s claims to be the rightful heir to the French throne and, after his invasion of France, culminates with his famous and improbable victory at the Battle of Agincourt and the negotiation of the Treaty of Troyes.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>Henry V</i> is believed to have been first performed in 1599 and first appears in a “bad” quarto in 1600, so-called because it contains a shortened version, likely unauthorized and potentially just based on a performance. This quarto was republished again in 1602 by a different printer and again in 1619. The first definitive text is the version published in the 1623 <i>First Folio</i>.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play is the last part of a series of four history plays written by Shakespeare, including <i>Richard II</i>, <i>Henry IV, Part 1</i>, and <i>Henry IV, Part 2</i> and many of characters like Henry (who appears as a wild young Hal in the <i>Henry IV</i>s), Pistol, Bardolph, and Mistress Quickly would have therefore been familiar to the audience. It contains some of Shakespeare’s most memorable lines and is often held up as a powerful portrayal of inspirational leadership.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>\n\t\t",

It was initially published in the First Folio under Shakespeare’s name only, but in 1850 James Spedding, an English author and expert on the works of Francis Bacon, suggested that the play was a collaboration with John Fletcher, a playwright who later replaced Shakespeare in the King’s Men acting company. Modern scholars mostly tend to agree, though the theory is still controversial as it’s based on textual analysis and not any historical mention of a collaboration. The play is also famous for having burned down the Globe Theatre in 1613 during one of its early performances, when a cannon shot special effect lit the theater’s thatched roof on fire.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In the play, King Henry’s closest advisor, Cardinal Wolsey, is hated by the citizens of England. Wolsey has imposed unfair taxes and unpopularly executed the Duke of Buckingham for treason. While at a party, the King falls madly in love with Anne Bullen and plans to divorce his current wife, Katherine of Aragon. Wolsey is asked to help his King in this endeavor, all the while becoming even more hated by the English and their Queen.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>\n\t\t",

Shakespeare based it on the legendary King Leir of the Britons, whose story is outlined in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s pseudohistorical <i>History of the Kings of Britain</i> (written in about 1136).</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play tells the tale of the aged King Lear who is passing on the control of his kingdom to his three daughters. He asks each of them to express their love for him, and the first two, Goneril and Regan do so effusively, saying they love him above all things. But his youngest daughter, Cordelia, is compelled to be truthful and says that she must reserve some love for her future husband. Lear, enraged, cuts her off without any inheritance.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The secondary plot deals with the machinations of Edmund, the bastard son of the Earl of Gloucester, who manages to convince his father that his legitimate son Edgar is plotting against him.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>After Lear steps down from power, he finds that his elder daughters have no real respect or love for him, and treat him and his followers as a nuisance. They allow the raging Lear to wander out into a storm, hoping to be rid of him, and conspire with Edmund to overthrow the Earl of Gloucester.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play is a moving study of the perils of old age and the true meaning of filial love. It ends tragically with the deaths of both Cordelia and Lear—so tragically, in fact, that performances during the Restoration period sometimes substituted a happy ending. In modern times, though, <i>King Lear</i> is performed as written and generally regarded as one of Shakespeare’s best plays.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>\n\t\t",

It was first published in quarto in 1600 and later collected into <i><abbr>Mr.</abbr> William Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies</i> in 1623. The earliest recorded performance of <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> was performed for the newly-married Princess Elizabeth and Frederick the Fifth, Elector Palatine in 1613.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Shakespeare’s sources of inspiration for this play can be found in Italian culture and popular texts published in the sixteenth century. Gossip involving lovers deceived into believing each other false was often spread throughout Northern Italy. Works like Ludovico Ariosto’s <i>Orlando Furioso</i> and Edmund Spencer’s <i>Fearie Queene</i> also feature tricked lovers like Claudio and Hero. Besides these similarities, the idea of tricking a couple like Benedick and Beatrice into <em>falling in love</em> was an original and unusual idea at the time.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play focuses on two couples: upon the noblemen’s return to Messina, Claudio and Hero quickly fall in love and wish to marry in a week; on the contrary, Benedick and Beatrice resume their verbal war, exchanging insults with each other. To pass the time prior to the marriage a plot to trick Benedick and Beatrice into falling in love has been set in motion. Unbeknownst to both our couples, a fouler plot to crush the love and happiness between Hero and Claudio has also begun to unfold.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>\n\t\t",

From 1592 to 1593, an outbreak of the bubonic plague swept through England, killing almost 20,000 people. In January 1593 city officials ordered the theaters in London to shut their doors, and work for the famous playwright and actor came to a halt. Shakespeare turned to writing poetry to make ends meet during the closures. While the plague hindered his work in theaters, it provided source material for some of his most famous plays.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>He first published “Venus and Adonis” in 1593, followed by “The Rape of Lucrece” in 1594. While both narrative poems contain sexual themes, their views on love versus lust are in stark contrast. After the theaters reopened, Shakespeare continued to write poetry and went on to publish “The Passionate Pilgrim” and “The Phoenix and the Turtle.” The last of his poems were published in his 1609 quarto, containing 154 sonnets and “A Lover’s Complaint.” The sonnets cover an array of themes: different types of romantic love, real beauty versus clichéd beauty, and the responsibilities of being beautiful.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition includes all of his poems and is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>\n\t\t",

In order to continue his wasteful spending, he raises taxes on the commoners and leases portions of English land to wealthy noblemen. He also sees an opportunity to seize more land and money after hearing news of John of Gaunt’s failing health.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>King Richard arrives at Windsor Castle to settle a dispute between Henry Bolingbroke, the Duke of Hereford and son of John of Gaunt, and Thomas Mowbray, the Duke of Norfolk. Bolingbroke accuses Mowbray of numerous counts of treason: embezzling funds for Richard’s soldiers, conspiring against the king for the past eighteen years, and murdering the Duke of Gloucester. Mowbray denies these charges and claims to have repented for any wrongs he has caused in the past. John of Gaunt tries to convince the two to reconcile, but his attempts fall on deaf ears. Richard determines that a trial by combat will settle the matter.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>\n\t\t",

The remaining Lancastrian leaders are either killed or scattered to the four winds. Within the kingdom, not everyone is happy with their new king—and when Edward falls ill, his power-hungry brother Richard, the Duke of Gloucester, sees his chance and prepares to kill anyone who stands between him and the throne.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Richard puts into play numerous schemes to eradicate the line of succession and control the court. The first victim is King Edward’s other brother, Clarence. Rumors lead to Clarence’s imprisonment in the Tower of London, and Richard sends two murderers to stab him to death. This causes Edward’s health to worsen, and the title of Protector falls to the remaining brother. Next on Richard’s hit list is Lord Hastings, the loudest voice to object to Richard’s accession, and who is promptly arrested and executed for treason. As Richard orchestrates murder after murder, the deaths start coming back to haunt him.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>\n\t\t",

During the late 1500s many playwrights loved to base their plays off of Italian stories, and Shakespeare was no different; he was heavily influenced by the Italian tale “The Goodly History of the True and Constant Love of Romeo and Juliett.” Today <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> continues to spread its influence within literature and performing arts. It has been adapted into 24 operas, numerous films, a ballet, and has also been referenced in law. The play has entertained generations with its romance, deception, revenge, sword-fighting, creative verse, comedic relief, and tragic fate.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The prologue lays before us the fate of our star-crossed lovers: two Italian households have a long, ongoing vendetta against each other, kept under control only by Prince Escalus, the ruler of Verona. Romeo meets with his friends Benvolio and Mercutio after having his heart broken by Rosaline. Encouraged to find love elsewhere, Mercutio sneaks him into one of Capulet’s masked parties, where he encounters Juliet, Capulet’s daughter. This is the beginning of a love affair that is destined to end in tragedy.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition.</p>\n\t\t",

Traveling with him was his wife, his twin sons, and their twin slaves. The family becomes separated during a tempest; Aegeon, one son, and one slave were rescued together, and the others were never to be seen again. Years later his son Antipholus and his slave Dromio left to search for their long lost siblings; after the boys didn’t return, Aegeon set out to bring his son back home.

Some speculate that <i>Merry Wives</i> was written at the behest of Queen Elizabeth I, who wanted to see Falstaff in love; and that Shakespeare was forced to rush its creation as a result, and so it remains one of Shakespeare’s lesser-regarded plays.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The play revolves around two intertwined plots: the adventures of the rogue Falstaff who plans to seduce several local wives, and the story of young Anne Page who is being wooed by prominent citizens while she has her sights set on young Fenton. The wives come together to teach Falstaff a lesson, and in the end love triumphs.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> is believed to have been first performed in 1597 and was subsequently published in quarto in 1602, in a second quarto in 1619, and then in the 1623 <i>First Folio</i>. Despite holding a lesser place in Shakespeare’s canon, it was one of the first Shakespearean plays to be performed in 1660, after the reinstatement of Charles II and theatre once again was permitted to be performed in London.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch and John Dover Wilson’s 1923 Cambridge edition.</p>\n\t\t",

      "description": "\n\t\t\t<p><i>The Country Wife</i> was first performed in January 1672 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. It traces several plot lines, the principle of which follows notorious rake Harry Horner’s attempt to carry on affairs by spreading a rumor that he was now a eunuch and no longer a threat to any man’s wife. It was controversial for its sexual explicitness even in its own time, having several notorious scenes filled with extended sexual innuendo and women carousing, singing riotous songs, and behaving exactly like their male counterparts.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>With the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the eighteen year ban on theater imposed by the Puritans was lifted. Charles II’s time in France had nurtured a fascination with the stage and, with his enthusiastic support, Restoration drama was soon once again a thriving part of the London culture—but it provided a completely different experience from Jacobean theater.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Christopher Wren’s newly built Theatre Royal provided a modern stage that accommodated innovations in scenic design and created a new relationship between actors and the audience. Another novelty, imported from France, was the presence of women on stage for the first time in British history. Restoration audiences were fascinated and often aghast to see real women perform, matching their male counterparts both in their wit and use of double entendre.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-wycherley\">William Wycherley</a> had spent some of the Commonwealth years in France and become interested in French drama. Borrowing extensively from Molière and others, he wrote several plays for this new theater, with his last two comedies, <i>The Country Wife</i> and <i>The Plain Dealer</i>, being the most famous. At the time, <i>The Country Wife</i> was considered the bawdiest and wittiest play yet seen on the English stage. It enjoyed popularity throughout the period but, as mores shifted and became more strict, the play was eventually considered too outrageous to be performed at all and between 1753 and 1924 was generally replaced on the stage by David Garrick’s cleaned-up, bland version.</p>\n\t\t",

In 1790 a duel he participated in led him to be put under arrest in Turin; during his confinement in a tiny chamber, he wrote his most famous work, “A Journey Round My Room.”</p>\n\t\t\t<p>“Journey” is a short story written as a parody of the grand travelogues popular at the time. He frames his six weeks’ confinement as a long journey across the unknown land of his room, visiting the furniture, the paintings on the wall, and even venturing to the north side. De Maistre didn’t hold the work in very high regard, but after his brother had it published in 1794 it became a fast success, eventually calling for a sequel (“A Night Journey Round My Room”), and warranting allusions in fiction by writers like <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/d-h-lawrence\">D. H. Lawrence</a>, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/wilkie-collins\">Wilkie Collins</a>, <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/w-somerset-maugham\">W. Somerset Maugham</a>, and Jorge Luis Borges.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The rest of his literary corpus is modest, and consists entirely of short works. “The Leper of the City of Aosta” is a philosophical dialogue on the struggles of a leper whose days are seemingly filled with unending sorrow; “The Prisoners of the Caucasus” is the fictional narrative of a captured general and his faithful servant, set against a rich background of Cossack factions in the Caucasus of Imperial Russia reminiscent of <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy\">Tolstoy’s</a> <i><a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/hadji-murad/aylmer-maude\">Hadji Murád</a></i>; and “The Young Siberian” is the true story of Prascovia Lopouloff, a poor Russian girl who sets out on a journey to secure an imperial pardon for her exiled father.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>De Maistre never set out to have a literary career, but his carefully-considered output made him famous across the continent.</p>\n\t\t",

The fort survived two sieges by Native Americans, first in 1777 and again in 1782.

The rider, a man named Lassiter, is a gunslinger known for his exploits in other Mormon settlements further north.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Lassiter’s intercession on Venters’ behalf sets off a chain reaction of threats, violence, theft, and murder as Jane Withersteen fights to maintain both her ranch and her independence.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>First published in 1912, <i>Riders of the Purple Sage</i> is considered to have played a prominent role in shaping the Western genre. It was <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/zane-grey\">Zane Grey’s</a> best-selling book and has remained popular ever since.</p>\n\t\t",

In contrast to her earlier collection <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/zitkala-sa/old-indian-legends\"><i>Old Indian Legends</i></a>, which is a collection of traditional Dakota legends, <i>American Indian Stories</i> is a collection of stories about contemporary Dakota life. Many center on the interactions and conflicts between Dakota and settler society, especially the challenges posed by the assimilationist Indian residential school system. The first few stories (through “Why I Am a Pagan”) are autobiographical in nature, drawing on Zitkála-Šá’s own experience as a student and then teacher in residential schools. Her story “The Softhearted Sioux” about a Sioux man’s loss of cultural and religious identity was even attacked as “trash” by her employer at the Carlisle School, Richard Henry Pratt (the coiner of the infamous slogan “kill the Indian, save the man”).</p>\n\t\t",

The collection was compiled in 1901 when Zitkála-Šá returned to her birthplace in the Yankton reservation to take care of her mother, after she had spent several years in the assimilationist Indian residential school system, both as a student and as an educator. While taking care of her mother, she gathered traditional tales from Dakota storytellers which were retold in English for <i>Old Indian Legends</i>. The stories revolve around various spirits and heroes from Dakota myth, especially Iktomi, a shapeshifting spider trickster.</p>\n\t\t",
